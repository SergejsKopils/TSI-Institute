# Business Intelligence and Data Visualization

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of an interactive dashboard analyzing a large-scale dataset from a North American retailer specializing in home goods and groceries. The goal was to uncover insights related to sales trends, inventory management, and financial performance across multiple brand stores from 2017 to 2020.

I acted as a Business Intelligence (BI) consultant and utilized **Tableau Public** to create an interactive dashboard allowing stakeholders to explore data dynamically for strategic decision-making.
