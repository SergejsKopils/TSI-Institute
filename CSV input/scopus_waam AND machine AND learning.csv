The process parameters variation and heat flow affect the geometric precision of the parts, when compared to the actual dimensions. Therefore, in situ geometry monitoring which is integrated in such a way to enable a backward control model is essential in the WAAM process. In this article, an attempt is made to study the effect of four input variables, namely voltage (U), welding current (I), travel speed and wire feed rate on the output function in the form of two geometrical characteristics of a single weld bead. These output functions which are determinant of the weld quality are width of weld bead (BW) and height of weld bead (BH). A machine learning approach is utilised to predict the bead dimensions based on the input parameters and to predict the parameters by assigning suitable scores. For predicting the bead dimensions, two models, namely linear regression and random forest, shall be utilised, whereas for the purpose of classification based on weld parameters, k-nearest neighbours model shall be employed. Through this work, a wide dataset of parameters in the form of input variable and output in the form bead dimensions are generated for 316LSi filler material which shall be used as a training data for a machine learning algorithm. Subsequently, the predicted parameters shall be cross-checked with actual parameters. © The Author(s) 2024.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:50","2024-12-14 21:49:51","","3205-3214","","12","68","","Weld.

However, potential defects may occur during the process, such as pores, cracks, lack of fusion, inclusions, delamination, and geometrical deviations. These defects are undesirable and have negative effects. To optimize the performance of the as-built components, and to reduce the potential defects, a feasible solution is to conduct in-process sensing and provide feedback to the control system. This article aims to give a comprehensive review of recent progress on sensing technologies, such as optical, acoustic, vision, thermal, and multiple signals-based sensing technologies, and the application of machine learning to enhance the ability to extract the needed feedback from the in-process monitoring raw data. Effective monitoring of different types of defects typically requires different sensing technologies, focus points, and attentions. Multi-sensor-based sensing systems may thus be needed to provide full-scale information. These necessities include the need for in-time data fusion and more complex data processing.

Without optimization, inherent temperature gradients can cause powerful residual stresses and microstructural defects. There is therefore a need for data-driven methods allowing real-time process optimization for WAAM. This study focuses on machine learning (ML)-based prediction of temperature history for WAAM-produced aluminum bars with different geometries and process parameters, including bar length, number of deposition layers, and heat source movement speed. Finite element (FE) simulations are used to provide training and prediction data. The ML models are based on a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) and performed well during baseline training and testing, giving a testing mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 0.7% with an 80/20 train–test split, with low variation in model performance. When using the trained models to predict results from FE simulations with greater length or number of layers, the MAPE increased to an average of 3.22% or less, with greater variability. In the cases of greatest difference, some models still returned a MAPE of less than 1%. For different scanning speeds, the performance was worse, with some outlier models giving a MAPE of up to 14.91%.

However, WAAM induces a degree of uncertainty in the process stability and the part quality owing to its non-equilibrium thermal cycles and layer-by-layer stacking mechanism. Anomaly detection is therefore necessary for the quality monitoring of the parts. Most relevant studies have applied machine learning to derive data-driven models that detect defects through feature and pattern learning. However, acquiring sufficient data is time- and/or resource-intensive, which introduces a challenge to applying machine learning-based anomaly detection. This study proposes a multisource transfer learning method that generates anomaly detection models for balling defect detection, thus ensuring quality monitoring in WAAM. The proposed method uses convolutional neural network models to extract sufficient image features from multisource materials, then transfers and fine-tunes the models for anomaly detection in the target material. Stepwise learning is applied to extract image features sequentially from individual source materials, and composite learning is employed to assign the optimal frozen ratio for converging transferred and present features. Experiments were performed using a gas tungsten arc welding-based WAAM process to validate the classification accuracy of the models using low-carbon steel, stainless steel, and Inconel. © 2023 The Author(s).","2023","2024-12-14 21:09:51","2024-12-14 21:49:23","","1423-1442","","4","10","","J.

However, due to the multi-process-variability in the WAAM process, the deposited shape (bead width, height, depth of penetration) is difficult to predict and control within the desired level. Ultimately, the overall build will not achieve a near-net shape and will further hinder the part from performing its functionality without post-processing. Previous research primarily utilizes data analytical models (e.g., regression model, artificial neural network (ANN)) to forwardly predict the deposition width and height variation based on single or cross-linked process variables. However, these methods cannot effectively determine the optimal printable zone based on the desired deposition shape due to the inability to inversely deduce from these data analytical models. Additionally, the process variables are intercorrelated, and the bead width, height, and depth of penetration are highly codependent. Therefore, existing analysis cannot grant a reliable prediction model that allows the deposition (bead width, height, and penetration height) to remain within the desired level. This paper presents a novel machine learning framework for quantitatively analyzing the correlated relationship between the process parameters and deposition shape, thus providing an optimal process parameter selection to control the final deposition geometry. The proposed machine learning framework can systematically and quantitatively predict the deposition shape rather than just qualitatively as with other existing machine learning methods. The prediction model can also present the complex process-quality relations, and the determination of the deposition quality can guide the WAAM to be more prognostic and reliable. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed quantitative process-quality analysis will be validated through experiments. © 2022 by the authors.

The work specifically focuses on three materials from the nickel alloy family (Inconel 718, Invar 36 and Inconel 625) and uses three sensor responses for data analysis, which are welding voltage, welding current and welding audio. Two different machine learning models are used—artificial neural networks (ANNs) and random forests (RF). The results for each of the materials, separately, indicate that the accuracies range from 60% to 90% and the correlation coefficient is less than 0.5 (indicating weak positive correlation), depending on the model and material. In addition to separate material analysis, a cross-material data analysis was formed to test the models’ general prediction capabilities. This led to predictions that are significantly worse, with accuracies ranging from 20% to 27% and very weak correlation coefficients (less than 0.1), indicating that the choice of material is still important as a boundary condition. Analysis of the results indicates that the relative importance of audio sensor response depends on the nature of defect formation. Random forests are found to perform the best for single material analysis, with the comparatively inferior performance of ANNs possibly being due to lack of sufficient datapoints. © 2023 by the authors.","2023","2024-12-14 21:09:51","2024-12-14 21:49:32","","","","11","13","","Metals","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: A.

This novel approach allows to generate large, artificial data sets as training data for machine learning methods by combining experimental results to generate a regression equation based on the experimentally measured t8/5 cooling time. Therefore, using the regression equations in combination with numerically calculated t8/5 cooling times an accurate prediction of the mechanical properties was possible in this research with an error of only 2.6%. Thus, a small set of experimentally generated data set allows to achieve regression equations which enable a precise prediction of mechanical properties. Moreover, the validated numerical welding simulation model was suitable to achieve an accurate calculation of the t8/5 cooling time, with an error of only 0.3%. © 2021 by the authors.

For example, wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) offers high-deposition rates on large printing areas by robotic-assisted welding of thick-layers of material. However, WAAM technologies suffer from low geometric accuracy due to unstable high temperature deposition processes. Physics-based and machine learning (ML) methods have been developed to predict and control WAAM geometric accuracy. These methods rely on accurate layer identification or segmentation from dense point clouds. However, layer segmentation can be challenging and time-consuming due to high surface roughness, excessive layer remelting, and severe out-of-plane layer displacement. To enable fast and accurate layer segmentation for geometric qualification of fabricated parts, we propose an efficient ML algorithm that exploits knowledge of the idealize layer geometry to identify the boundaries between deposited layers. Simulation studies demonstrate the accuracy of the procedure under limited surface roughness conditions. Experimental studies illustrate the applicability of the methodology in practice.  © 2023 IEEE.","2023","2024-12-14 21:09:51","2024-12-14 21:49:28","","","","","2023-August","","","","","","","","IEEE Computer Society","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

For large-scale and complex components, the material loss and cycle time of wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) are lower than those of conventional manufacturing.

Therefore, new technologies need to be developed to achieve high-precision and high-efficiency WAAM. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyses the innovations in high-precision WAAM in the past five years from a mechanistic point of view. Findings: Controlling heat to improve precision is an effective method.

In this process, controlling the temperature evolution is very important since it directly influences the quality of the deposited parts. Typically, the temperature history in WAAM can be obtained through experiments and/or numerical simulations, which are generally time-consuming and expensive. In this research, we developed a robust surrogate model (SM) for predicting the temperature history in WAAM based on the combination of machining learning (ML) and finite element (FE) simulation. The SM model was built to predict the temperature history in the WAAM of single weld tracks. For this purpose, the FE model was first developed and validated against experiments. The FE model was subsequently used to generate the data to train ML models based on feed-forward neural network (FFNN). The trained SM model can fast and accurately predict the temperature history in the cases which were not previously used for training with a very high accuracy of more than 99% and in a very short time with only 38 s (after being trained) as compared with 5 h for a FE model. The trained SM can be used for studies that require a large number of simulations such as uncertainty quantification or process optimization. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","2023","2024-12-14 21:09:51","2024-12-14 21:49:42","","4651-4663","","9-10","126","","Int J Adv Manuf Technol","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: X.

For this reason, wire-based additive manufacturing (WBAM) is a strong candidate to compete with subtractive manufacturing techniques and forging. Compared to powder-based, WBAM presents higher layer thickness, thus having higher build-up and deposition rates, despite lower-dimensional accuracies and surface roughness. However, WBAM and powder-based AM are not concurrent technologies since both produce parts for different applications. Problems in EBAM are amplified due to the large part sizes; residual stresses and distortion from the high heat input directly impair the part quality. Furthermore, the thermal history resulting from the repetitive layering is responsible for generating complex metallurgical phenomena, requiring investigations to select the best combination of process parameters and deposition strategy for each material. Nonetheless, since WBAM processes use the same principles of welding with filler material (or, in the case of AM, feedstock), advances are taking place faster. Accordingly, WBAM techniques such as wire and arc AM (WAAM), wire-based electron beam AM (w-EBAM or EBAM), and wire and laser additive manufacturing (WLAM) have achieved maturity, proving their feasibility in producing parts for critical structural applications in fields such as aerospace. This chapter is destined to expose recent research conducted on the WBAM of Ti and NiTi alloys, compare different WBAM techniques, introduce the use of cored wires for AM, present new AM processes, and give a brief and concise overview of artificial intelligence applied to additive manufacturing. First, the section clarifies cold metal transfer (CMT) as an AM technique presenting some of its features and capabilities, subsequently comparing it to WAAM. This section is finished with a comparison between solid and cored wires, the latter a new need for fusion wire-based processes; pros and cons are given based on practical observations. The second section groups two classes of alloys additively manufactured by EBAM: Ti and NiTi alloys. EBAM is firstly introduced where general features of the process are presented, followed by process parameters, pros and cons. In sequence, the EBAM of Ti-64 alloy is shown with results based on microstructural aspects, thermal history, and phase transformation. The EBAM of NiTi follows a different approach, exploring recent publications of this newborn processing of NiTi alloys. Comparisons with techniques (WAAM and LPBF) show how EBAM may influence functional properties. Therefore, the focus is put on the influence of processing on the transformation temperatures and superelastic behaviour. The outlook comprises two wire-based AM techniques: resistance welding and liquid metal AM. The former recently introduced and baptised Joule Printing gained visibility due to its astonishing printing speed. Liquid metal was introduced two decades ago and is based on the Lorentz force to drop the feedstock. General information is exposed to understand each process. Another important segment of AM bases its layering method on friction, specifically friction stir welding. Features of this process are indicated, and practical examples are depicted with Al and Ni alloys. Ultrasonic metal AM is also represented afterwards, with basic information about the process and examples of components. At last, the effects of coupling artificial intelligence to additive manufacturing and its benefits are enlightened, with applications for both machine and deep learning as well as future trends in, e.g., topology optimisation. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

It also substantially affects the material penetration, part accuracy, and thickness of subsequent layers. The present study focuses on the effect of processing parameters on single-bead geometry for fabricating 316LSi stainless steel in pulsed-mode metal transfer WAAM. Models were developed by utilizing multiple regression modelling, machine learning (ML) based on back propagation neural network (BPNN), and finite element modelling (FEM) with four process parameters, wire feed rate (WFR), torch travel speed (TTS), voltage (V), and contact tip-to-substrate distance (CTSD), each considered at three levels. Response surface methodology was utilized for design of experiments to obtain three-bead geometry responses, namely width of weld bead (WWB), height of weld bead (HWB), and depth of penetration (DOP). The results confirm that all three proposed models predict bead geometry reasonably. However, accuracy of ML-based BPNN method is better as compared to the regression and FEM-based approaches. For multi-objective optimization, a desirability function approach is used, which predicts the optimal conditions at WFR of 4.0 m/min, TTS of 284.545 mm/min, voltage of 18.0 V, and the CTSD of 12.0 mm for minimum WWB, maximum HWB, and minimum DOP. A multi-layered wall of SS316LSi is fabricated with optimized process parameters, and it is found that the ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, and percentage elongation are 546.3 MPa, 440.1 MPa, and 43.7%, respectively. WAAM-deposited structure reveals stable deposition, no debonding/delamination, and complete fusion between layers.

Among the several AM techniques, Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is notable for its ability to produce large metal components, which makes it particularly appealing in the aerospace sector. However, precise control of the bead geometry, specifically bead width and height, is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of WAAM-manufactured parts. This paper introduces a methodology using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for forecasting the bead geometry in the WAAM process, focusing on gas metal arc welding cold metal transfer (GMAW-CMT) WAAM. This study addresses the challenges of bead geometry prediction by developing a robust predictive framework. Key process parameters, such as the wire travel speed, wire feed rate, and bead dimensions of the previous layer, were monitored using a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) to ensure precision. The collected data were used to train and validate various regression models, including linear regression, ridge regression, regression, polynomial regression (Quadratic and Cubic), Random Forest, and a custom-designed DNN. Among these, the Random Forest and DNN models were particularly effective, with the DNN showing significant accuracy owing to its ability to learn complex nonlinear relationships inherent in the WAAM process. The DNN model architecture consists of multiple hidden layers with varying neuron counts, trained using backpropagation, and optimized using the Adam optimizer. The model achieved mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of 0.014% for the width and 0.012% for the height, and root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 0.122 for the width and 0.153 for the height. These results highlight the superior capability of the DNN model in predicting bead geometry compared to other regression models, including the Random Forest and traditional regression techniques. These findings emphasize the potential of deep learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of WAAM processes. © 2024 by the authors.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:51","2024-12-14 21:49:21","","","","19","24","","Sensors","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.-H.

By adjusting WAAM process parameters, dimensions of WAAM-produced weld beads can be optimized. To this end, the current study adopted the cold metal transfer (CMT) process to produce different-sized beads of CoCrFeNiMo0.2 high-entropy alloy (HEA), varying WAAM parameters and linking them with the formed bead dimensions and bead-substrate contact angles. Three machine learning algorithms, namely back propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR), were used to predict bead dimensions and contact angles under various WAAM parameters. The BPNN model has great prediction performance in the height of beads. The SVR model has the highest accuracy in predicting the width and cross-sectional area of beads. The RFR model outperforms the other two models in contact angles prediction.

The technology comes with the flexibility and material efficiency of additive manufacturing processes while mitigating the disadvantages through high material deposition rates and high energy efficiency. However, the prevalence of the technology is inhibited by its geometrical inaccuracy and the large induced residual stresses. This work tackles the former problem by capturing the process parameter-geometry relationship using Machine Learning. To do so, multiple mild steel welding beads with varying shape features like corner angles are printed using a Metal Inert Gas welding machine attached to an industrial robot. The cross-sectional profile of the printed beads is measured using a point laser sensor and correlated through a Multilayer Perceptron to input features such as travel speed, wire feed speed, and shape features. By incorporating varying corner angles, a holistic model, not limited to geometry prediction of straight beads only, is trained. Using the model, excess material at the inner angle of corners determined by the overlapping regions of the two adjacent beads can be predicted. By generating a database of possible bead shapes an inverse algorithm that suggests welding parameter combinations that yield a smooth bead shape at the corner is created, thus enabling improvement of the overall accuracy of the Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:51","2024-12-14 21:49:46","","","","","84","","Addit.

However, proving component quality is a challenge because it is not possible to produce 100% defect-free components. In addition to this, statistically determined fluctuations in the wire quality, gas flow, and their interaction with process parameters result in a quality of the components that is not 100% reproducible. Complex testing procedures are therefore required to demonstrate the quality of the components, which are not cost-effective and lead to less efficiency. As part of the project “3DPrintFEM”, a sound emission analysis is used to evaluate the quality of AM components. Within the scope of the project, an approach was being developed to determine the quality of an AM part dependent not necessarily on its geometry. Samples were produced from WAAM, which were later cut and milled to precision. To determine the frequencies, the samples were put through a resonant frequency test (RFM). The unwanted modes were then removed from the spectrum produced by the experiments by comparing it with FEM simulations. Later, defects were introduced in experimental samples in compliance with the ISO 5817 guidelines. In order to create a database of frequencies related to the degree of the sample defect, they were subjected to RFM. The database was further augmented through frequencies from simulations performed on samples with similar geometries, and, hence, a training set was generated for an algorithm. A machine-learning algorithm based on regression modelling was trained based on the database to sort samples according to the degree of flaws in them. The algorithm’s detectability was evaluated using samples that had a known level of flaws which forms the test dataset. Based on the outcome, the algorithm will be integrated into an equipment developed in-house to monitor the quality of samples produced, thereby having an in-house quality assessment routine. The equipment shall be less expensive than conventional acoustic equipment, thus helping the industry cut costs when validating the quality of their components. © 2024 by the authors.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:51","2024-12-14 21:49:49","","","","11","17","","Mater.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: S.P.

A digital camera was installed with a WAAM setup to obtain the images of beads after deposition. A single layer of deposition was conducted on a substrate using aluminium 5356 alloy filler wire using robotic-controlled gas-metal arc welding (GMAW) setup. The performance of the ML model was validated using classification accuracy and processing time. The developed CNN model was checked with three types of proposed datasets. The dataset containing the training and testing ratio of 60:40 achieved an accuracy of 86.53% and 88.08% with 30 and 60 epochs respectively for testing.

Thus, the lack of uniformity or geometrically defective bead will subsequently lead to voids in the printed part, which will have a great impact on the overall part quality and mechanical strength. To resolve this, several techniques have been proposed to identity such defects using vision or thermal-based sensing, so as to aid in the implementation of in-situ corrective measures to save time and cost. However, due to the environment that they are operating in, these sensors are not an effective way of picking up irregularities as compared to acoustic sensing. Therefore, in this paper, we seek to study into three acoustic feature-based machine learning frameworks - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) + K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) + Neural Network (NN) and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) + Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and evaluate their performance for the real-time identification of geometrically defective weld bead. Experiments are carried out on stainless steel (ER316LSi), bronze (ERCuNiAl) and mixed dataset containing both stainless steel and bronze. The results show that all three frameworks outperform the state-of-the-art acoustic signal based ANN approach in terms of accuracy. The best performing framework PCA+KNN outperforms ANN by more than 15%, 30% and 30% for stainless steel, bronze and mixed datasets, respectively.

This work focuses on the study of the WAAM process using an approach based on machine learning and statistical data analysis to solve the problem of weld quality classification. In this study, experiments were carried out to explore the essential parameters of this process, such as welding speed, wire feed rate and electric current, with the aim of producing high-quality weld layers in terms of geometry. The resulting data from the experiments were rich in information. In order to efficiently manage the data collected during these experiments, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving its relevance. Then, several machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes Gaussian and SVM, were used to predict welding quality based on parameter data generated by PCA. To evaluate and compare the performance of these models, evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score and confusion matrix were used. Following this comparative evaluation, we identified that the Random Forest model is the most accurate, capable of reliably predicting part quality based on various combinations of parameters.

This framework consists of four steps. First, the experimental data, including process parameters and signatures, are obtained by performing tests in various conditions. Next, the model is constructed by surrogate modeling or a machine learning algorithm using the obtained data. Then, the uncertainties in a quantity of interest (QoI), such as bead geometry, surface roughness, microstructure, or mechanical properties, are quantified. Lastly, the UQ is verified and validated using the experimental data. The proposed framework is demonstrated with the data-driven UQ of the bead geometry on the bead-on-plate in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW)-based WAAM. In this case study, the uncertainty sources are process parameters and signatures, and the QoI is bead geometry. The process parameters are wire feed rate (WFR), travel speed (TS), and current, while the process signatures are voltage-related features. The bead geometry includes the width and height of single-layer single bead. The results of the case study has revealed that (1) verifying and validating the data-driven UQ of bead geometry with the normal beads is conducted, and the predicted values are within the 99% confidence intervals, (2) the bead width is negatively correlated with TS, and (3) the bead height has a positive and negative correlation with WFR and TS, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","2023","2024-12-14 21:09:52","2024-12-14 21:48:40","","5519-5540","","11-12","125","","Int J Adv Manuf Technol","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: K.

Different analytical and numerical modeling methods have been introduced to predict the H/W ratio. However, the accuracy of these predictions is relatively low due to the challenges associated with handling complex and non-linear regression equations. This study addressed the challenges by implementing data-driven predictive modeling to predict the H/W ratio from the input process parameters. A stacking ensemble learning approach is employed, where a meta-model integrates predictions from multiple base learners to enhance overall performance. The model performance was evaluated by Coefficient of determination (R2), mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The model was validated by comparing the experimental and predicted values based on which five thin walls are printed with different heat inputs. The study also explores the impact of heat input on microstructure, mechanical, and corrosion properties. The findings indicate that a significantly low heat input (178 J/mm) and higher heat inputs (> 356 J/mm) decrease the wire utilization. With increasing heat input, ferrite content increases, microstructures become coarser, dendritic spacing increases, and ferrite transitions from lathy to skeletal. Further, lower heat input (235 J/mm) reduces δ-ferrite, suppresses atomic segregation, and increases Cr and Mo in the matrix. YS and UTS decrease with higher heat inputs, anisotropy decreases, and Vickers microhardness drops from 228 (178 J/mm) to 194 Hv (586 J/mm). Additionally, the corrosion resistance deteriorates with increasing heat input, as evidenced by higher pitting potential (Epit: 0.389 V vs. 0.368 V vs. −0.023 V) and lower corrosion current density (Icorr: 6.76 ×10−7 A/cm2 vs. 7.946 ×10−7 A/cm2 vs. 8.91 ×10−7 A/cm2) for heat inputs of 235 J/mm, 281 J/mm, and 356 J/mm, respectively. © 2024 Institution of Structural Engineers","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:52","2024-12-14 21:48:38","","","","","68","","Structures","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: R.

The most critical challenge in WAAM is to achieve the desired surface roughness of deposited layers. The improvement of surface roughness can play an important role in improving the quality of parts made using WAAM. In this study, three machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and XGboost algorithm, have been used to predict the surface roughness of deposited beads. A dataset for training and testing the ML models has been obtained using a 3D optical profilometer by measuring the surface roughness of a single-layer deposited bead of aluminium alloy. The performance of ML algorithms was evaluated using statistical metrics such as mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2). Tuning of hyperparameters helped in improving the performance of ML models.

Here, special emphasis is given to wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), a directed energy deposition process that employs arc welding tools and wire to build metallic components by deposition of weld material. The WAAM process has several advantages, e.g., low cost, rapid deposition rate, and suitability for large complex metallic components. However, many WAAM challenges such as large welding deformation, undesirable porosity, and components with high residual stress remain to be overcome. Multidisciplinary cross-fusion research involving manufacturing, material science, automation control, and artificial intelligence/machine learning (ML) are deployed to overcome the above-mentioned problems. ML enables improved product quality control, process optimization, and modeling of complex multiphysics systems in the WAAM process. This research utilizes a data-driven literature review process, a defined and deliberate approach to localizing, evaluating, and analyzing published studies in the literature. The most relevant studies in the literature are analyzed using keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis. Numerous aspects of WAAM, including design for WAAM, material analytics/characterization, defect detection/monitoring, as well as process modeling and optimization, have been examined to identify state-of-the-art research in ML for WAAM. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for using ML in the WAAM process are identified and summarized. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2023.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:52","2024-12-14 21:48:51","","2407-2439","","6","35","","J Intell Manuf","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: A.

Therefore, a dexel-based process simulation for wire and arc additive manufacturing is implemented to predict the resulting geometry of the deposited material depending on the process parameters. In order to make accurate predictions and consider the effects of the process parameters on the geometry, a multi-stage model is developed for three different materials. The results of this prediction pipeline show an R of 0.82 for the width and 0.76 for the height.

Most researchers considered weld bead width, height, and penetration as the characteristic performance in WAAM. However, layer roughness is also important because it affects the machining cost and mechanical properties of fabricated parts. If the roughness of a deposited layer can be reduced, less machining will be required, and material wastage will be reduced. Reduced layer roughness will also enable better bonding between adjacent layers. Hence, the deposition of weld beads with minimized roughness demands great attention. A few researchers who tried to investigate roughness in WAAM used straight paths for material deposition, but the investigation of the weaving path, which has a great potential to reduce layer roughness, has not been investigated well. The main contribution of this paper is about successfully implementing two machine learning methods to accurately model surface roughness in WAAM using a weaving path: Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) which is also known as Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Both methods are effective for modeling and predicting the layer roughness for a given set of robotic WAAM parameters, but Random Forest gave better results than MLP in terms of accuracy and computational time. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","2021","2024-12-14 21:09:52","2024-12-14 22:14:00","","543-552","","","70","","J.

As a promising technology for the manufacturing industry, it is necessary to develop an automated WAAM system with high efficiency and low labour cost. Generally, to achieve a fully intelligent WAAM system, the first step is to develop an intelligent weld bead modelling system which is able to provide users with appropriate welding parameters in terms of producing components with high accuracy. Knowledge from many disciplines, such as computer science, material engineering, mechanical engineering, and industrial system engineering, is advantageous to develop such an automated system. Thus, an intelligent bead modelling system was developed by integrating a number of industrial sectors in this study. The bead modelling system includes three critical modules, including data generation module, model creation module, and welding parameter generation module. It is worth mentioning that a novel algorithm using Support Vector Machines (SVM) was proposed for creating the model with a high level of accuracy. Optimal combinations of wire feed rate and travel speed under various temperatures were generated accordingly. The experiment results demonstrated that the system can significantly improve product quality and reduce manufacturing costs, including raw material usage and manual labour. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","2021","2024-12-14 21:09:52","2024-12-14 22:14:04","","","","","23","","J.

Temperature predictions require an accurate process model, which is usually either a physics-based or a data-driven simulator. Although many high-performance models have been developed, they all suffer from disadvantages such as long execution times, the need for large datasets, and error accumulation in long prediction horizons. These caveats undermine the utility of such modeling approaches and pose problems in their integration within iterative optimization and closed-loop control schemes. In this work, we introduce GPyro, a generative model family specifically designed to address these issues and enable fast probabilistic temperature predictions. GPyro combines physics-informed and parametric regressors with a set of smooth attention mechanisms and learns the evolution of the dynamics inherent to a system by employing Gaussian processes. The model predictions are equipped with confidence intervals quantifying the uncertainty at each timestep. We applied GPyro to Wire-arc additive manufacturing and learned an accurate model from a single experiment on a real welding cell, almost in real-time. Our model can be easily integrated within existing loop-shaping and optimization frameworks. © 2022, The Author(s).","2023","2024-12-14 21:09:52","2024-12-14 21:48:33","","243-259","","1","34","","J Intell Manuf","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: I.

By using robotic arc welding and wire filler materials,WAAM can fabricate complex large near-net shape parts with high deposition rates, short lead times and millimeter resolution. However, due to high temperature gradients and residual stresses, currentWAAM technologies suffer from high surface roughness and poor shape accuracy. This limits the adoption of these technologies in industry and complicates process control and optimization. Since its conception, considerable research efforts have been made on improving the mechanical and microstructural performance of WAAM components while few studies have investigated their geometric accuracy. In this work, we propose an engineering-informed machine learning (ML) framework for predicting and compensating for the geometric deformation of WAAM fabricated products based on a few sample parts. The proposed ML algorithm efficiently separates geometric shape deviation into deformation and surface roughness. Then, the predicted shape deformation of a new product is minimized by applying optimal geometric compensa- tion to the product design. Experimental validation on cylindrical shapes showed that the proposed methodology can effectively reduce product shape deviation, which facilitates the widespread adoption of WAAM.

The complexity of the process makes it inherently unstable, which can cause various defects, resulting in poor geometric accuracy and material properties. This demands for in-process monitoring and control mechanisms to industrialize the technology. In this work, process monitoring algorithms based on welding camera image analysis are presented. A neural network for semantic segmentation of the welding wire is used to monitor the working distance as well as the horizontal position of the wire during welding and classic image processing techniques are applied to capture spatter formation. Using these algorithms, the process stability is evaluated in real time and the analysis results enable the direction independent closed-loop-control of the manufacturing process. This significantly improves geometric fidelity as well as mechanical properties of the fabricated part and allows the automated production of parts with complex deposition paths including weld bead crossings, curvatures and overhang structures. © The Author(s) 2024.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:53","2024-12-14 21:48:25","","","","","","","J Intell Manuf","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: J.

In this paper, a three-dimensional scaled steel plate model (120 mm × 24 mm × 6 mm) is built for numerical simulations to replace the expensive physical WAAM experiments. A series of thermo-metallo-mechanical analyses is conducted by using ABAQUS CAE user subroutines in which, thermal, metallurgical and mechanical models for gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process are implemented. Groups of variables in WAAM process namely wire melting current, voltage and torch moving speeds, as well as interval layer cooling coefficients, are chosen as input parameters of the artificial neural network (ANN). The two targeted values are hardness and ultimate strength of the steel plate model, which are obtained by fully coupled thermo-metallo-mechanical simulations or by quick results from commercial software JmatPro, and by real measurements on the test samples of WAAM experimental plates. In this primary study, Taguchi algorithm is used for data preparations of the numerical experiments. The tests are fulfilled with Neural Networks (NN) tool in MATLAB. A typical three-layer feedforward network is used for general works. The developed models show good prediction capability for hardness and ultimate strength.

However, its high heat accumulation and complex thermal evolution strongly affect the resulting microstructures and mechanical properties. The heterogeneous and unpredictable nature of these properties hinder the widespread application of WAAM in the steel construction industry. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) hardness model is developed, based on a thermal–metallurgical model for mild steel. The objective is to establish non-linear relationships between the input process parameters and the desired output, i.e., hardness. The thermal–metallurgical model utilizes a well-distributed heat source model, a death-and-birth algorithm, and a metallurgical model to simulate the temperature field and to calculate the microstructure phase fraction. The temperature prediction errors at four thermocouple positions are mostly below 20%. Because of the limited experimental data, twenty-five simulation experiments are performed using the L25 orthogonal array based on the Taguchi method. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) reveals that the travel speed has the greatest impact on hardness. With the dataset from the thermal–metallurgical model, an ANN model to predict hardness is developed. A comparison to experimental data shows excellent performance and accuracy, with the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of ANN predictions within 10% of the targeted hardness. © 2024 by the authors.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:53","2024-12-14 21:09:53","","","","5","14","","Metals","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: W.

The most prominent cases are found in aerospace engineering, where intricate structures are produced by forging and subsequent machining or by machining from solid blocks of material. Due to the large scrap rate involved in conventional manufacturing, rib-web structures are suitable applications for additive manufacturing (AM) processes. Among the AM processes, wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is highly suitable for rib-web structures due to its high deposition rate and the potential to manufacture large-size parts. In WAAM, the welding strategy greatly influences the properties and quality of deposited parts. With an increasing number of starts and stops, the danger of uneven material build-up and welding defects increases. Unfortunately, most rib-web structures do not represent Eulerian paths, i.e. they cannot be manufactured with a continuous welding motion, in which every edge is visited only once. This study presents a novel strategy for generating optimal tool paths for WAAM of lightweight rib-web structures, mitigating the disadvantages of discontinuous welding paths such as welding defects and uneven build-up. It is shown that doubling the number of welding passes on each edge of the rib-web structure turns non-Eulerian paths into Eulerian paths, which can be welded continuously. When two or more weld beads are deposited on each edge, the vertices of the rib-web structure may suffer from underfilling. It is shown that this can be avoided by a correction strategy, which consists in manufacturing the part once, evaluating the size of voids in the junctions, and computing a correction to deposit the required amount of material into the center of the junction. While this strategy may be used if a single part is considered, it is shown that the tool path correction to be applied to arbitrary junction geometries can be represented by a neural network that is derived from an experimental database consisting of representative junction types. With this approach, paths for any rib-web geometry can be generated, which saves lead time in variant-rich production. The paths proposed in this work avoid non-welding moves and may hence outperform even single weld-bed strategies in terms of welding efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","2020","2024-12-14 21:09:53","2024-12-14 22:13:59","","","","","35","","Addit.

The present study conducted a comparative analysis of five machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict the bead geometry in wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). A robotic-controlled gas metal arc welding (GMAW) based WAAM setup was employed to deposit the beads. For the purpose of training and testing the ML models, a dataset consisting of four independent variables (travel speed, torch angle, wire feed rate, and contact tube to workpiece distance) and two dependent variables (bead height and width) was collected. The study employed five ML models including decision tree, random forest, XGBoost algorithm, linear regression, and artificial neural networks (ANN). The performance of ML models was evaluated using statistical metrics such as index of merit (IM), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2 value). A comparison of ML algorithms revealed that ANN (R2 value = 0.6505) performed better than the XGBoost (R2 value = 0.5916) in predicting the bead height. The lowest value of MSE and MAE equal to 0.0611 and 0.1893 respectively was achieved for ANN in predicting the bead height. For the prediction of bead width, linear regression (R2 value = 0.8486) performed better than ANN (R2 value = 0.8316). The lowest value of MSE and MAE equal to 0.1730 and 0.3157 respectively was achieved for linear regression in predicting the bead width. Linear regression is most suitable for datasets having strong collinearity, however, ANN, Random Forest and XGBoost performed very well in prediction when the dataset shows high non-linear relations. The comparison of ML algorithms revealed that computational work using machine learning gives high-performance results with minimal use for resources and time. Hence, machine learning can be the most effective computational tool in modern manufacturing industries. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature 2023.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:53","2024-12-14 21:52:33","","6625-6638","","9","18","","Int.

This paper presents an approach based on semi-supervised learning for real-time anomaly detection in the production of Inconel 718 components via the Pulsed Transfer WAAM process. The workflow is based on the use of training data obtained by employing established process parameters, similar to what is done in Welding Procedure Qualification Records (WPQRs), to develop a semi-supervised anomaly detection application. The proposed approach involves depositing material using the already established process parameters and collecting the corresponding welding data in terms of welding current and voltage sensor signals. The collected data are then employed to train an unsupervised algorithm by using solely good deposition data to learn hidden complex patterns of normality and hence detect anomalies based on deviations from these patterns. With this aim, global and local features are extracted from the welding current and voltage sensor signals in both time and time-frequency domains via Wavelet Transform technique and a deep learning approach based on a residual convolutional autoencoder. To showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a case study involving wire arc additive manufacturing of Inconel 718 components was conducted. The proposed algorithm was tested and achieved an F-score of 0.895, representing a 30 % improvement over state-of-the-art methods that rely on time domain features for anomaly detection. This research work contributes to the improvement of anomaly detection methodologies, offering substantial advantages over alternative techniques for quality control and reliability of additive manufacturing processes such as WAAM. © 2024 The Authors","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:53","2024-12-14 21:48:04","","84-97","","","128","","J.

Although this topic is well discussed in the literature, current methods rely on black-box approaches, limiting our understanding of why anomalies occur, making complex the root cause identification and the consequent decision support about the action to take to mitigate them. This work addresses these limitations by proposing a structured workflow designed to enhance the explainability of anomaly detection models. Using the wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) process as a case study, we examined 14 wall structures printed with INVAR36 alloy under varying process parameters, producing both defect-free and defective parts. These parts were classified based on surface appearance and welding camera images. We collected welding current and voltage data at a 5 kHz sampling rate and extracted features from both time and frequency domains using a knowledge-based approach. Isolation Forest, k-Nearest Neighbor, Artificial Neural Network, XGBoost, and LGBM models were trained on these features, and the results shown best performance of boosting models, achieving F1 scores of 0.927 and 0.945, respectively. These models presented higher performance compared to other models like k-Nearest Neighbor, whereas Isolation Forest and Artificial Neural Network posses lower performance due to overfitting, with an F1 score of 0.507 and 0.56, respectively. Then, by leveraging the feature importance capabilities of these models, we identified key signal characteristics that distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior, improving the explainability of the detection process and in general about the process physics. © 2024 by the authors.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:53","2024-12-14 21:53:32","","","","21","12","","Mathematics","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: G.

It has been actively investigated to monitor metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes for quality control and has been proven effective. However, typical CNN algorithms inherently have two issues when used in metal AM processes. First, in many cases, acquiring datasets with sufficient quantity and quality, as well as necessary information, is challenging because of technical difficulties and/or cost intensiveness. Second, determining a near-optimal CNN model takes considerable effort and is time-consuming. This is because the types and quality of datasets can be significantly different with respect to different AM processes and materials. The study proposes a novel concatenated ensemble learning method to obtain a flexible and robust algorithm for in-situ anomaly detection in wire + arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), a type of wire-based direct energy deposition (DED) process. For this, data, as well as machine learning models, were seamlessly integrated to overcome the limitations and difficulties in acquiring sufficient data and finding a near-optimal machine learning model. Using inexpensively obtainable and comprehensive datasets from the WAAM process, the proposed method was investigated and validated. In contrast to the one-dimensional and two-dimensional CNN models' accuracies of 81.6 % and 88.6 %, respectively, the proposed concatenated ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 98 %. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:53","2024-12-14 21:48:19","","273-289","","","112","","J.

This approach gives WAAM great potential among metal additive manufacturing processes for its ability to produce larger scale components much faster than powder-based processes. The selection of certain initial WAAM process parameters, such as input power and interlayer dwell time, can often impact the stability of the contact-tip-to-workpiece distance (CTWD), current, voltage, and linear energy density during deposition. The resulting process stochasticity can cause variations in part geometry, microstructure, and mechanical properties. Therefore, it is desirable to create process models that can predict these WAAM process condition values for a variety of initial process parameter settings. These predictions can then be used to optimize initial WAAM process parameter settings or forecast when process condition instability is expected to occur. In the present work, single-bead multi-layer walls are deposited using a variety of input power and interlayer dwell time settings. Two different modeling approaches are then investigated: multilayer perceptron (MLP) regression and time series forecasting. An artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to predict process condition values based on the initial WAAM process parameters and a given time in the deposition process. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and long-short term memory (LSTM) time series models are trained to forecast subsequent process condition values based solely on the previous process condition values with no prior knowledge of the initial WAAM process parameters. The models are evaluated and compared based on their accuracy in predicting data streams of CTWD, current, voltage, and linear energy density. Additionally, the effect of training data quantity on model accuracy is examined for each model approach. For the ANN model, the training data size is decreased by reducing the resolution of the time series data as a whole and by reducing the number of layers that are used in the training dataset. For the ARIMA and LSTM models, the training data size is limited by reducing the resolution of the time series process data. Additionally, the lag order or “lookback” period, which is a key hyperparameter of both models that represents that number of previous data points needed to forecast a subsequent data point, is optimized via a grid search when the models are trained. Overall, this study will seek to provide modeling techniques to minimize process condition instability by optimizing initial WAAM process parameters and to forecast process condition instability so that it can potentially be mitigated. © 2024 by ASME.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:53","2024-12-14 21:53:34","","","","","1","","","","","","","","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Since this technology is still under investigation, it is important to determine the efficiency of the process; in this sense, the melting efficiency stands out not only as a parameter of interest in energy terms but also as a measure of the stability of the process. For calculating melting efficiency, it is necessary to use tailored colorimeters or apply models requiring specific dimensions that involve destructive testing. For this reason, in the development of this work, the melting efficiency is evaluated through machine learning algorithms. Processing parameters such as wire diameter, wire feed speed, travel speed, and net power are used to determine melting efficiency. In addition, a simplified analytical model was developed to compare the results. The average melting efficiency analytically calculated was 44.56 ± 5.48%, while the predicted value reaches a comparable value of 44.32 ± 4.79% obtained with the Gaussian process regressor, which shows the highest accuracy. Moreover, the known relationship with travel speed was verified. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","2022","2024-12-14 21:09:53","2024-12-14 21:52:35","","3123-3133","","5-6","120","","Int J Adv Manuf Technol","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 23; Correspondence Address: J.A.

Thus, having geometrically non-uniform beads will lead to voids in the final printed part, which will significantly impact its overall quality and mechanical strength. The uniformity of beads depends on the proper choice of process parameters, namely the torch speed and wire feed rate. However, it is impossible to print all different combinations of these parameters to model the bead accurately, as printing them is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, in this paper, we propose building a process map based on the probability that a weld bead is geometrically uniform using support vector machine. Experiments are carried out on the Bronze and Stainless Steel material datasets. The results show that the generated process map co-relates well with that of a manual quantization approach. © 2022","2022","2024-12-14 21:09:54","2024-12-14 21:49:09","","113-118","","","70","","","","","","","","Elsevier Ltd","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Mater.

Despite great efforts, the prediction of distortion and resulting geometry in additive manufacturing processes using WAAM remains challenging. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) is established to predict welding distortion and geometric accuracy for multilayer WAAM structures. For demonstration purposes, the ANN creation process is presented on a smaller scale for multilayer beads on plate welds on a thin substrate sheet. Multiple concepts for the creation of ANNs and the handling of outliers are developed, implemented, and compared. Good results have been achieved by applying an enhanced ANN using deformation and geometry from the previously deposited layer. With further adaptions to this method, a prediction of additive welded structures, geometries, and shapes in defined segments is conceivable, which would enable a multitude of applications for ANNs in the WAAM-Process, especially for applications closer to industrial use cases. It would be feasible to use them as preparatory measures for multi-segmented structures as well as an application during the welding process to continuously adapt parameters for a higher resulting component quality. © 2021 by the authors.

Specifically, we investigate into a variety of acoustic features, namely the Root Mean Square of Pressure (RMSP), Energy, Mean Amplitude, Kurtosis, Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR), Skewness, Crest Factor and Peak-to-peak, and print process parameters, namely Torch Speed (TS) and Wire Feed Rate (WFR) combined with Machine Learning (ML) frameworks for detecting geometrically defective print segments. Experiments carried out on Inconel 718 show that among the studied frameworks, using acoustic features and process parameters with Random Forest (RF) performs best in terms of F1 score at 89%, while using acoustic features and process parameters with Support Vector Machine (SVM) performs best in picking out defective segments based on the Confusion Matrix. These findings serve as our first step in developing an intelligent sensing system for the early identification of defective beads in the WAAM printing process, so that appropriate intervention can be implemented to save printing resources and material costs. In addition, the proposed approach has the advantage of detecting defects within a more localized region for more targeted intervention.

It combines the advantages of Additive Manufacturing, such as geometrical flexibility and material efficiency, while overcoming its limitations through high material output and energy efficiency. However, the widespread adoption of WAAM is hindered by its tendency to produce large residual stresses and geometrical inaccuracies. The latter is often approached by modeling the influence of process parameters on the bead geometry using Machine Learning (ML). This work, for the first time, combines data from multiple published sources to generate a more holistic and transferable ML model. To assess and improve model transferability, different sets of WAAM process parameters and ML models, including physics-informed ML models, are tested.

Anomalies in the WAAM process, such as inclusion, porosity, and lack of fusion, can have unpredictable effects on the quality of the final product. While some studies have investigated anomaly detection methods in the WAAM process, they mainly rely on supervised learning methods that require extensive manual labeling, with less attention paid to unsupervised models. Furthermore, most studies focus on significant anomalies that are rare in actual production, limiting their practical application. This paper proposes a two-stage unsupervised defect detection framework based on online melt pool video data. By considering the motion characteristics of the manufacturing process, a revised threshold method is used to detect anomalies during the WAAM process. Combining machine contextual information, the physical spatial location of defects is further identified and displayed through a human-machine interactive interface.

In this work, we study the effect of process parameters (current, travel speed) and the layer number on prediction responses using three popular machine learning (ML) approaches. We report the performance of the most suitable model to independently predict the bead height and width using the input variables. Performance analysis of different ML models indicates that the random forest (RF) ML model predicts the for-layer height and width with accuracies up to 94 % and 99%, respectively. In addition, we also show that through RF ML model-based prediction of current and travel speed from the geometry data (bead height and width), it is possible to achieve accuracy up to 93% and 94%, respectively. Since the RF ML model-based prediction of process parameters from process responses (as well as the prediction of process responses from process parameters) is based on empirical analysis of data, it is expected that the geometric accuracy of a real-life deposition of an object considerably improves, thereby minimising the material loss. © 2023","2023","2024-12-14 21:09:54","2024-12-14 21:50:53","","248-253","","","80","","","","","","","","Elsevier Ltd","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Mater.

However, WAAM is also prone to the generation of defects, so the timely identification of anomalies is important to reduce the waste and get components of high quality. To develop anomaly detection application, the feature extraction process represents a key ingredient which allows machine learning systems to analyze big data. Waveform GMAW welding processes are typically used in WAAM to reduce the heat input supplied to the material and avoid defects such as excessive bending of parts and residual stress. These processes are based on the controlled dip transfer principle, so the waveforms should repeat themselves during deposition. This suggests that the frequency content of the voltage and current welding signals acquired during the process can provide important information about the process state. In this research, an experimental campaign was conducted to collect data for pulsed welding and surface tension transfer (STT) processes during the deposition of mild steel ER70S6, stainless steel 316L, Aluminum 4043, and Inconel 718 alloys. Welding voltage and current signals were acquired during the building processes, and a frequency domain analysis was conducted using the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with the aim to extract features from signals aiming to better separate the feature space, which means improve anomaly detection performance in detecting defects like arc instability, porosity, geometrical defect due to arc blow and humping. Furthermore, a methodology based on time-frequency analysis enhanced by Gabor filter for texture anomaly detection of scalograms obtained by Morlet Continuous Wavelet Transform is proposed, which showed an improvement of performance in separation between normal and anomalous deposition of several materials under different welding technologies. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:54","2024-12-14 21:53:24","","","","","","","J.

Among these, acoustic-based sensing has the advantage of low cost and shows the most potential to identify both external and internal defects as an in-situ monitoring system. Using acoustic signals, researchers have broadly investigated non-machine learning and machine learning-based approaches to identify defects like balling, micro defects, lack of fusion pores, keyhole pores, cracks, and porosity. While most of these works have shown promising results for laser-based AM systems, few have explored how acoustic signals can be used effectively for Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) defect detection. This paper proposes a methodology to construct machine learning (ML)-based models on identifying geometrically defective bead segments using acoustic signals during the WAAM process. Geometrically defective bead segment or geometric defect is a defect that causes voids in the final printed part due to incomplete fusion between two non-uniform overlapping bead segments. Such a defect is currently not explored in the literature. The proposed methodology uses a novel dataset labeling approach to identify good and bad bead segments based on an optimal threshold of the range of mean curvature. Furthermore, the methodology targets defective bead segments based on acoustic feature inputs like Principal Components (PC) or Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). To understand the resulting performance of the defect identification models constructed based on the proposed methodology, experiments are performed and tested on a variety of ML models (KNN, SVM, RF, NN, and CNN) based on the Inconel 718 material. The results show that the combinatorics of two acoustic input features and five ML models can be able to identify geometrically defective segments accurately with F1 score that ranges from 80% to 85%. © 2023 The Author(s).

In WAAM, if a bead is deposited without considering the central angle, its shape may collapse with increasing number of layers. To address this problem, a new method for optimizing the bead geometry using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was established in this study. The ranges of the optimal deposition conditions were determined using the SVM classifier and verified by experiments. Geometric data of deposited beads were extracted using a laser profiler, and an SVM binary classifier was used to predict suitable ranges of the deposition conditions. Data were extracted through 20 single-layer basic experiments, classification was performed based on 4°, and the appropriateness of SVM classification was found through 8 single-layer and 3 multi-layer verification experiments. The results showed that the SVM classifier successfully selected the ranges of the optimal deposition conditions. Verification experiments revealed that the results in all cases were appropriately classified based on the boundary of the classification line. Moreover, the SVM classifier was efficient even when a small amount of input data was available. The contribution of this study is that the developed method can help build desired bead geometries in scenarios where deposition is required in the WAAM process, such as re-manufacturing. Thus, this method can be used in real-world industrial applications through further research on the bead shape with multi-layer deposition. © 2023 The Authors","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:54","2024-12-14 21:53:22","","","","1","10","","Heliyon","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: C.-M.

However, quality issues are critical in WAAM because it builds upon arc welding technology, which can result in low precision and poor quality of the melted parts. Hence, anomaly detection is essential for identifying abnormal behaviors and process instability during WAAM to reduce the time and cost of post-process treatment. The relevant studies have been conducted on anomaly detection algorithms using machine learning in fused deposition modeling and laser powder bed fusion; however, they have less investigated the implementation for in situ quality monitoring in WAAM. This work presents a real-time anomaly detection method that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) in WAAM. The proposed method enables creation of CNN-based models that detect abnormalities by learning from the melt pool image data, which are pre-processed to increase learning performance. A prototype system was implemented to classify melt pool images into “normal” and “abnormal” states, with the latter accounting for balling and bead-cut defects. Experiments were conducted using molybdenum, a cost-intensive and hard-to-machine material. Four CNN-based models were created using MobileNetV2, DenseNet169, Resnet50V2, and InceptionResNetV2. Then, their performances were validated in terms of classification accuracy and processing time. The MobileNetV2 model yielded the best performance with 98 % of classification accuracy and 0.033 s/frame of processing time. This model was also compared with an object detection algorithm named “YOLO”, which yielded 73.5 % of classification accuracy and 0.067 s/frame of processing time. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","2022","2024-12-14 21:09:54","2024-12-14 22:13:57","","","","","302","","J Mater Process Technol","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Elsevier Ltd","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 65; Correspondence Address: S.-J.

WAAM systems are increasingly employed in the industry and academia, but there are still several challenges and barriers to process stability control. The process stability is highly dependent on how the molten feed wire is added into the melt pool, which is known as the droplet transfer mode. To ensure a stable WAAM deposition process, it is essential to maintain the transfer mode in a suitable stable status. Without an effective transfer mode control method, the operators need to determine and control the transfer mode based on their experience using manual adjustment, which is difficult to achieve in a long period of production process. In this paper, a deep learning-based technology was proposed for the control of the droplet transfer mode based on the data collected from the WAAM process. A long short term memory neural network was applied as the core transfer mode classification model. A time-series data, arc voltage, was collected and statistical and frequency features were extracted, which included 11 relevant features, as the inputs of the classification model. Then, the distance between the melted wire and the melt pool was adjusted based on the determined transfer mode to keep a suitable stability of the process. A case study was used to evaluate the proposed approach and to show its merit. The proposed approach was compared to three commonly used machine learning algorithms, k-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, and decision tree. The proposed method obtained the highest accuracy in determining the transfer mode, which was over 91%. The performance of the proposed approach was also evaluated by the single-pass and oscillated wall building. The proposed deep learning based approach improved the process stability in real-time, which resulted in better deposition qualities, in terms of geometry size and processing cleanliness compared to without control. Furthermore, this data-driven method could be applied to other WAAM processes and materials. © 2022, The Author(s).","2022","2024-12-14 21:09:54","2024-12-14 21:50:54","","2179-2191","","7","33","","J Intell Manuf","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 14; Correspondence Address: Y.

Understanding the relationship between input factors and layer geometry is crucial for studying the process comprehensively and developing various industrial applications such as slicing software and feedforward controllers. Statistical tools such as clustering and multivariate polynomial regression provide methods for exploring the influence of input factors on the final product. These tools facilitate application development by helping to establish interpretable models that engineers can use to grasp the underlying physical phenomena without resorting to complex physical models. In this study, an experimental campaign was conducted to print steel components using WAAM technology. Advanced statistical methods were employed for mathematical modeling of the process. The results obtained using linear regression, polynomial regression, and a neural network optimized using the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) were compared. To enhance performance while maintaining the interpretability of regression models, clusterwise regression was introduced as an alternative modeling technique along with multivariate polynomial regression. The results showed that the proposed approach achieved results comparable to neural network modeling, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.25 mm for layer height and 0.68 mm for layer width compared to 0.23 mm and 0.69 mm with the neural network.

Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) excels in precision but is limited by a low deposition rate and chamber size; WAAM offers cost-effectiveness, high efficiency, and scalability for large components; BJ enables precise material deposition for customized parts with environmental benefits; FSAM achieves fine grain sizes, low defect rates, and potential for precision products; and I-AM boasts a high build rate and industrial adaptability but is less studied recently. This paper attempts to explore the possibilities and challenges for future research in AM. Among them, two issues are how to mix different AM applications and how to use the integration of Internet technologies, machine learning, and process modeling with AM, which are innovative breakthroughs in AM. © 2024 by the authors.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:54","2024-12-14 21:53:29","","","","15","17","","Mater.","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: B.

However, it is challenging to achieve high productivity in arc additive metal part applications, as it requires consistent manufacturing, reliable quality, and predictable performance. The service performance of arc additively manufactured components is often influenced by microstructure, widely distributed defects, deep residual stresses, and complex surface roughness. To this regard, investigating the Process-Structure–Property-Performance (PSPP) relationships via both experimentation and simulation is a proven strategy for furthering the capabilities of additive manufacturing. Nowadays, Machine Learning (ML) can also be a powerful tool for modelling these complex, nonlinear relationships. This paper begins with a brief overview of WAAM process classification, and a generic description of process control. It then proceeds to a comprehensive review and discussion of how component microstructure, internal defects, surface roughness, and residual stress, all impact mechanical and fatigue properties of WAAM components. Additionally, it includes a detailed exploration of the latest advancements in using ML to predict these effects, focusing on PSPP modelling.

Three sensors are used in the digital shadow: a welding electric signal sensor, a camera, and a laser profilometer to collect welding current and voltage data, image data, and point cloud data. The collected multi-scaled data are time and spatially synchronized by sampling multiple points along the welding path.

One alternative to mitigate geometry-related flaws is to use algorithms that optimise trajectory choices—for instance, using heuristics to find the most efficient trajectory. The algorithm can assess several trajectory strategies, such as contour, zigzag, raster, and even space-filling, to search for the best strategy according to the case. However, handling complex geometries by this means poses computational efficiency concerns. This research aimed to explore the potential of machine learning techniques as a solution to increase the computational efficiency of such algorithms. First, reinforcement learning (RL) concepts are introduced and compared with supervised machining learning concepts. The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem is explained and justified as a choice within the RL techniques. As a case study, a space-filling strategy was chosen to have this machining learning optimisation artifice in its algorithm for GMA-AM printing. Computational and experimental validations were conducted, demonstrating that adding MAB in the algorithm helped to achieve shorter trajectories, using fewer iterations than the original algorithm, potentially reducing printing time. These findings position the RL techniques, particularly MAB, as a promising machining learning solution to address setbacks in the space-filling strategy applied. © 2024 by the authors.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:54","2024-12-14 21:53:27","","","","3","8","","J.

One of the basic tasks in WAAM is to determine appropriate process parameters, which will directly affect the morphology and quality of the weld bead. However, the selection of process parameters relies heavily on empirical data from trial-and-error experiments, which results in significant time and cost expenditures. This paper employed different machine learning models, including SVR, BPNN, and XGBoost, to predict process parameters for WAAM. Furthermore, the SVR model was optimized by the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. A 3D laser scanner was employed to obtain the weld bead’s point cloud, and the weld bead size was extracted using the point cloud processing algorithm as the training data. The K-fold cross-validation strategy was applied to train and validate machine learning models. The comparison results showed that PSO–SVR predicted process parameters with the highest precision, with the RMSE, R2, and MAE being 1.1670, 0.9879, and 0.8310, respectively. Based on the process parameters produced by PSO–SVR, an optimal process parameter combination was chosen by taking into comprehensive consideration the impacts of power consumption and efficiency. The effectiveness of the process parameter optimization method was proved through three groups of validation experiments, with the energy consumption of the first two groups decreasing by 10.68% and 11.47%, respectively. © 2024 by the authors.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:54","2024-12-14 21:50:40","","","","5","14","","Metals","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: X.

Detecting defects during deposition is critical for halting production of low-quality components, thereby reducing waste and associated costs, and allowing timely process adjustments. This necessitates the integration of online anomaly detection systems in modern WAAM systems. While most existing methods rely on high-frequency data acquisition, this research explores the feasibility of using low-cost and low-frequency acquisition systems for anomaly detection, leveraging the advancements in Industry 4.0 and IoT protocols like MQTT. This study presents an IoT-driven intelligent system for WAAM, where data is collected at a low frequency of 10 Hz and processed using unsupervised machine learning techniques to develop an anomaly detection service. The methodology involves using a data-driven model to forecast WAAM process variables and detect anomalies through a Gaussian mixture model based on estimation errors between model estimation and real values collected from the process. The results obtained from various models were compared, specifically polynomial autoregression with exogenous variables (polyARX), autoregressive neural network with exogenous variables (ARXNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). The proposed system demonstrated high performance in anomaly detection, achieving an F2-score of 90.4% with the LSTM model and 86.28% with the ARXNN model when used to forecast the WAAM process. These results are comparable to performance reached with supervised machine learning algorithms or with results reached by previous studies which employ high-frequency data. Furthermore, the results show that low-frequency data, when processed with complex ML techniques, can reduce the chance of missing anomalies by 40% compared to traditional statistical methods, thanks to a higher recall. Finally, the implementation of the system using containerisation technologies like Docker was discussed, and post-deployment results confirmed the findings. Additionally, a graphical user interface was developed for operator interaction, utilising emerging IoT technologies such as Grafana and SQL databases, which represent additional parts of the IoT-driven intelligent WAAM system proposed in this work. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:55","2024-12-14 21:53:11","","2957-2974","","5-6","135","","Int J Adv Manuf Technol","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: G.

It provides higher deposition rates and larger build areas that make it an attractive technology for industry. An important element of WAAM process control is maintaining specific contact tip to work-piece distance (CTWD). Cumulative errors caused by modeling inaccuracies and thermal conditions can create an increase in CTWD during processing. In the present study, acoustic signals were investigated as a non-invasive form of monitoring this phenomenon and were compared with traditional current-based sensing approaches. Experiments were conducted across a range of controlled CTWD conditions. From the acoustic signals, 35 different statistical features were extracted and machine learning strategies were utilized to correlate them to the CTWD. Random forests composed of 50 trees each were chosen to classify the CTWD into three different levels of CTWD granularity. The ability of random forest algorithms to detect varying levels of CTWD was investigated and the models showed limited performance especially for high granularity CTWD predictions when compared to current sensing approaches. The implications for these results in rapid implementation for high-level process monitoring of process condition are briefly discussed.

However, there are a number of constraints preventing the integration of this technology into production. The most urgent issues are related with the quality assurance of the produced billets. Therefore, the purpose of the presented study is to assess the influence of WAAM modes on the geometric parameters of the billet's layers and to develop a method of control and diagnostics of the process using approaches of nonlinear dynamics and machine learning. The studies were conducted on a hybrid CNC machining center with the WAAM function. In the process of a multifactorial experiment, the walls with a height of 10 layers were grown in a wide range of values of the specific energy of surfacing. After the formation of each layer, its geometric parameters were measured: width and height in ten different sections. In parallel, the time se-ries of the acoustic emission signal in the substrate material, the current strength and the voltage of the electric arc were recorded. These signals were the basis for the reconstruction of the dynamical system's phase portraits. It is shown that an increase in the surfacing current leads to a monotonous increase in the values of the width and thick-ness of the layer, and an increase in voltage leads to a decrease in the height of the layers and an increase in the thick-ness. Changing the surfacing modes leads to a restructuring of the dynamic system's phase portrait and change in the values of the fractal dimension, the largest Lyapunov exponent and informational entropy. To guarantee the stability of the geometric parameters of the layers, the technique for diagnosing the 3D printing process using a nonlinear auto-regressive model with an external input (NARX) was proposed and tested. Optimal hyperparameters of the model were obtained: the number of hidden layers and the time delay of signals. The maximum achieved accuracy of the model was 12%. © 2023 Author(s).","2023","2024-12-14 21:09:55","2024-12-14 21:53:10","","","","","2999","","","","","","","","American Institute of Physics Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Issue: 1 Journal Abbreviation: AIP Conf.

Quality is a significant concern for AM components, and mainly the variations in product quality cause a major barrier to the general application of WAAM in a production environment. To solve this issue, welding arc stability, voltage, arc length, and bead geometry formation sensors have been widely used to detect defects of WAAM deposits.

The experimental findings and predicted data provide a valuable resource for achieving unique insight into WAAM processes and decision-making. Machine learning (ML) offers the opportunity to advance this insight by learning fundamental knowledge about WAAM processes and identifying predictive and actionable suggestions to optimize part quality and process design. The analysis of the defects of the first layer and successive layers data has been used to train the ML models and predict the WAAM process defects of further layers. The predictive models successfully developed the new prediction algorithms to detect the defects in WAAM deposited layers. The validation test was suitable for predicting the defects during the deposition process. © 2022, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.","2023","2024-12-14 21:09:55","2024-12-14 21:50:37","","447-455","","2","76","","Trans.

However, controlling surface roughness is very challenging in WAAM processes. Typically, machining methods are applied to reduce the surface roughness after a part is fabricated, which is costly and ineffective. Therefore, controlling the WAAM process parameters to achieve better surface roughness is important. This paper proposes a machine learning method based on Gaussian Process Regression to construct a model between the WAAM process parameters and top surface roughness. In order to measure the top surface roughness of a manufactured part, a 3D laser measurement system is developed. The experimental datasets are collected and then divided into training and testing datasets. A top surface roughness model is then constructed using the training datasets and verified using the testing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves less than 50 µm accuracy in surface roughness prediction. © 2022 by the authors.

Recently, considerable focus has been directed towards utilizing AI for the development of optimal control in industrial processes.

However, the existing deposition parameter planning methods struggle to offer continuous and precise parameters when the part geometry varies dynamically due to the long-term dependence, strong coupling, and hysteresis properties of the WAAM process. To address this challenge, this research introduces an advanced algorithm for generating accurate and continuous deposition parameters by learning and utilizing the welding skills of proficient human welders. The first step involves capturing kinematic and welding parameter data from proficient human welders during practical welding processes. Following this, a human skill learning algorithm is developed based on a combination of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) architecture and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to analyse and model human motions and bead deposition results. Lastly, a practical backward model is established to generate continuous deposition parameters for weld beads with varying geometry. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through the fabrication of two practical WAAM parts. The root mean square error (RMSE) values between the target geometry and the ground truth geometry of the parts are 0.1648 and 0.1805 respectively.

This paper presents a deep learning-based novel automatic defect detection solution, you only look once (YOLO)-attention, based on YOLOv4, which achieves both fast and accurate defect detection for WAAM. YOLO-attention makes improvements on three existing object detection models: the channel-wise attention mechanism, multiple spatial pyramid pooling, and exponential moving average. The evaluation on the WAAM defect dataset shows that our model obtains a 94.5 mean average precision (mAP) with at least 42 frames per second.

Since WAAM specimens vary in mechanical properties along the built direction, it is necessary to predict the properties and thereby reduce the experimental cost. Hence, machine learning tools that can enhance and make the process more efficient are being implemented for the current work. In this study, location and orientation-based tensile strength and elongation behavior have been studied. The elongation of WAAMed alloy specimens in vertical, inclined, and horizontal orientations are determined to be 44.1 ± 1.9%, 46.1 ± 2.2%, and 39.6 ± 2.2% respectively. From the experimental data, stress-strain curve prediction model is trained using machine learning algorithms conducted on a Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and k-nearest-neighbours. Features such as location, orientation, and applied stress are considered for predicting the strain generated during tensile testing. A subset of these features is used to improve prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. The predictive models are validated using the condition monitoring data collected from a set of WAAM samples’ tensile test data. Performance evaluation metrics are applied to find the accuracy of all the models. From the results, the RMSE values of 2.522, 0.765, 0.249, 0.234, 0.211, and R2 values of 96.15%, 99.06%, 99.95%, 99.96%, 99.97% are obtained for Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and k-nearest-neighbours respectively. Thus, the predictive modeling techniques help in predicting the elongation of WAAM samples with excellent accuracy, as demonstrated through testing the models. The k-nearest-neighbours machine learning model was found to be the best model for the present study and estimated the strain rate with R2 values of 99.97% accuracy and less than 2% error deviation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","2023","2024-12-14 21:22:24","2024-12-14 21:53:06","","","","","","","Int.

The approach adressed major topics in real-life data sets of industrial applications such as miscellaneous signal sample rates, lack of synchronization and concept drift. A reference data set based on an anomaly-dependently splitted time horizon was defined to reduce the sensitivity loss of the detector after an anomaly.

Thus, the accuracy of the printed geometry is largely dependent on the knowledge of the bead profile employed, which by itself is dependent on a variety of process parameters, such as wire feedrate and torch speed. Existing models for modelling bead profile are based on its width and height, which do not necessarily capture the geometry of the weld bead accurately. This could affect the step over increment strategy, which dictates the geometry of the resulting overlapping valley. In this paper, we formulate and evaluate the performance of a variety of machine learning framework for predicting the bead cross-sectional profiles. To model the geometry of a bead, we explored direct cartesian representations using polynomials and vertical coordinates, as well as a higher dimensional representation using planar quaternions for supervised learning. Experiments are conducted on single bead SS316L material to compare the various framework performance. We found that among these, the planar quaternion representation with a non-linear neural network framework captures and retains the curvature characteristics of the bead during the learning and prediction process most accurately with a mean Chi-Square goodness of fit of 0.026. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Compared with the neural network algorithm, the regression prediction model of arc additive manufacturing morphology based on XGBoost has a higher prediction accuracy. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","2019","2024-12-14 21:24:44","2024-12-14 21:42:02","","125-135","","","","","","","","","","","Springer","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Trans.

Rapid and reliable monitoring of the WAAM process is a key development for the technology as a whole, as it will enable components produced by the process to be qualified to relevant standards and hence be deemed fit for use in applications such as those found in the aerospace or naval sectors. Intelligent algorithms provide inbuilt advantages in processing and analysing data, especially for the large data sets generated during the long manufacturing cycles. Interdisciplinary engineering (IDE) furnishes a concept integrating computer science and industrial system manufacturing engineering together to treat large amounts of process monitoring data. In this work, a WAAM process monitoring and defect detection system integrating intelligent algorithms is presented. The system monitors welding arc current and voltage signals produced by the WAAM process and makes use of a support vector machine (SVM) learning method to identify disturbances to the welding signal which indicate the presence of potential defects. The incremental machine learning models developed in this work are trained via statistical feature analysis of the welding signals and a novel quality metric that improves detection rates is also presented. The incremental learning approach provides an efficient means of detecting welding-based defects, as it does not require large quantities of data to be trained to an operational level (addressing a major drawback of other machine learning methods). A case study is presented to validate the developed system, results show that it was able to detect a set of defects with a success rate greater than 90% F1-score. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","2021","2024-12-14 22:12:50","2024-12-14 22:13:48","","","","","","","Journal of Industrial Information Integration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 58; Correspondence Address: Y.
