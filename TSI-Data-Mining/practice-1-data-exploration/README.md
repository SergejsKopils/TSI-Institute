This reposity contains homework for the python-based "Data Mining" course, presented for master students of Transport and Telecommunication Institute through collaboration with the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol).

# Computer Practice 1. Data exploration and visualisation

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Auto MPG dataset to understand trends in fuel efficiency and vehicle characteristics.

## Data Cleaning
- Handled non-numeric values in the `horsepower` feature.
- Imputed missing values to ensure data completeness.

## Descriptive Analysis
- Computed summary statistics for continuous variables (e.g., MPG, weight, displacement).
- Analyzed categorical features such as number of cylinders and origin.

## Visualization
- Created various plots including histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and time-series charts to visualize distributions and relationships.
- Explored trends in MPG across different groups (cylinders, origin) and over time.

## Correlation Analysis
- Calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between MPG and attributes like weight, displacement, horsepower, and power-to-weight ratio.
- Investigated how power-to-weight ratio impacts fuel efficiency.

## Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Run
1. Load the Auto MPG dataset.
2. Run the data cleaning and preprocessing notebook/script.
3. Perform descriptive and correlation analysis.
4. Generate visualizations using the provided scripts.
