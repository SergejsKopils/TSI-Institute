This reposity contains homework for the python-based "Data Mining" course, presented for master students of Transport and Telecommunication Institute through collaboration with the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol).

Computer Practice 1. Data exploration and visualisation

Exploratory Data Analysis on Auto MPG Dataset  
- Conducted a comprehensive data exploration project on the Auto MPG dataset to analyze fuel efficiency trends and vehicle characteristics.  
  - Data cleaning: handled non-numeric values in 'horsepower', imputed missing values
  - Descriptive analysis: computed statistics for continuous and categorical features
  - Visualization: created histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and time-series charts
  - Correlation analysis: calculated Pearson coefficients between MPG and attributes like weight, displacement, horsepower, and power-to-weight ratio
  - Advanced analytics: examined MPG grouped by cylinders, origin, and over time; studied impact of power-to-weight ratio
  - Tools: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy
