# ðŸ§  Mushroom Risk Prediction and Grouping

This project was developed as part of the **Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics** course at Transport and Telecommunication Institute (TSI).

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `Sergejs_Kopils_ST83519_20241222_CP_ML.ipynb`: Main notebook with all steps of the machine learning pipeline
- `primary_data.csv`: Raw dataset containing mushroom features and class labels
- `Sergejs_Kopils_ST83519_20241222_CP_ML.pdf`: Final submitted report

## ðŸ“Š Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Predict whether a mushroom is **edible or poisonous** using supervised learning (Logistic Regression)
- Discover **natural groupings** in the data using unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering)

## ðŸ”§ Methods Used

### ðŸ”¹ Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned malformed CSV lines
- Filled missing values with the mode
- Encoded categorical features using `LabelEncoder`
- Scaled numerical features with `StandardScaler`

### ðŸ”¹ Classification: Logistic Regression
- Binary classification model (edible vs. poisonous)
- Evaluated with **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **AUC**
- Accuracy: ~63%, AUC: 0.56
- Cross-validation (10-fold) confirms stability of results

### ðŸ”¹ Clustering: K-Means
- Used **Elbow method** and **Silhouette score** to choose optimal `k`
- Visualized clusters with PCA (2D)
- Silhouette Score: 0.085 (suggests weak natural clusters in this dataset)

## ðŸ“ˆ Tools and Libraries
- Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`)
- Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
