Here, special emphasis is given to wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), a directed energy deposition process that employs arc welding tools and wire to build metallic components by deposition of weld material. The WAAM process has several advantages, e.g., low cost, rapid deposition rate, and suitability for large complex metallic components. However, many WAAM challenges such as large welding deformation, undesirable porosity, and components with high residual stress remain to be overcome. Multidisciplinary cross-fusion research involving manufacturing, material science, automation control, and artificial intelligence/machine learning (ML) are deployed to overcome the above-mentioned problems. ML enables improved product quality control, process optimization, and modeling of complex multiphysics systems in the WAAM process. This research utilizes a data-driven literature review process, a defined and deliberate approach to localizing, evaluating, and analyzing published studies in the literature. The most relevant studies in the literature are analyzed using keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis. Numerous aspects of WAAM, including design for WAAM, material analytics/characterization, defect detection/monitoring, as well as process modeling and optimization, have been examined to identify state-of-the-art research in ML for WAAM. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for using ML in the WAAM process are identified and summarized. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2023.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:52","2024-12-14 21:48:51","","2407-2439","","6","35","","J Intell Manuf","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: A.

One alternative to mitigate geometry-related flaws is to use algorithms that optimise trajectory choices—for instance, using heuristics to find the most efficient trajectory. The algorithm can assess several trajectory strategies, such as contour, zigzag, raster, and even space-filling, to search for the best strategy according to the case. However, handling complex geometries by this means poses computational efficiency concerns. This research aimed to explore the potential of machine learning techniques as a solution to increase the computational efficiency of such algorithms. First, reinforcement learning (RL) concepts are introduced and compared with supervised machining learning concepts. The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem is explained and justified as a choice within the RL techniques. As a case study, a space-filling strategy was chosen to have this machining learning optimisation artifice in its algorithm for GMA-AM printing. Computational and experimental validations were conducted, demonstrating that adding MAB in the algorithm helped to achieve shorter trajectories, using fewer iterations than the original algorithm, potentially reducing printing time. These findings position the RL techniques, particularly MAB, as a promising machining learning solution to address setbacks in the space-filling strategy applied. © 2024 by the authors.","2024","2024-12-14 21:09:54","2024-12-14 21:53:27","","","","3","8","","J.

This article innovatively combines the melt pool stress theory with visual perception algorithms to visually study the force balance of the near-suspended melt pool to predict the state of the melt pool. First, the method for melt pool segmentation was studied. The results show that the optimized U-net achieved high accuracy in melt pool segmentation tasks, with accuracies of 98.18%, MIOU 96.64%, and Recall 98.34%. In addition, a method for estimating melt pool force balance and predicting normal, sagging, and collapsing states of the melt pool is proposed. By combining experimental testing with computer vision technology, an analysis of the force balance of the melt pool during the inclined rod forming process was conducted, showing a prediction rate as high as 90% for the testing set. By using this method, monitoring and predicting the state of the melt pool is achieved, preemptively avoiding issues of broken rods during the printing process. This approach can effectively assist in adjusting process parameters and improving welding quality.

A better deposition efficiency can be achieved by understanding the parameters that may influence the geometry of the bead. This paper provides a review that focuses on the factors that may influence the formation of the 3D profile. The included factors are the flow pattern of the molten pool after deposition, the built structure and orientation, the heat input and cooling conditions, the welding parameters, and other uncertainties. This review aims to facilitate a better understanding of these factors and achieve the optimum geometry of the 3D parts produced.

One of the most common defects is porosity, which is detrimental to the mechanical and fatigue properties of the product. To guarantee the product quality, it is important to detect its occurrence. In this research, a strategy was developed to detect the occurrence of porosity and to identify its root cause. To develop a porosity detection strategy, a monitoring set-up was designed in which the WAAM process is monitored by a current sensor, condenser microphone, structural Acoustic Emission sensor, spectrometer and flow meter. Seventeen experiment samples were produced and the sensor data were stored using a data acquisition system. A sensor data analysis showed that current and acoustic signals could be correlated with the occurrence of porosity. From these sensor signals, 74 features were extracted. A validation of the samples, based on milling, grinding and image processing, was developed to obtain the pore density values for the corresponding feature set. A long short-term memory neural network was trained through supervised learning to classify feature data into acceptable or non-acceptable pore densities. A test accuracy of 82.52% was achieved. Apart from the porosity detection, a strategy for porosity root cause detection was developed in order to distinguish between process related porosity and contaminant related porosity. An accuracy of 90.67% was achieved, whereby the remaining inaccuracy is interpreted as a physical phenomenon and the results from the model are interpreted actually as more accurate than the prior assumption of the training labels. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.","2024","2024-12-14 21:14:26","2024-12-14 21:55:00","","1607-1628","","4","35","","J Intell Manuf","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: J.Y.I.I.

As a process in itself, additive manufacturing represents a more sustainable means of production as it eliminates the use of excess material and thus unnecessary waste. Wire and ARC additive manufacturing (WAAM) process is an important metal additive manufacturing process. The improvements in surface quality and dimensional accuracy are critical for WAAM. In the current work, two contemporary artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms, teaching learning–based optimization (TLBO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), are applied for optimizing the five process parameters such as wire feeder, pulse voltage, frequency, pulse time, and welding speed with four objectives such as current, voltage, heat input, and width-to-reinforcement ratio which are considered as referred from Youheng et al. (Int. J. Adv. Manuf. Technol. 91:301–313, 2017). The results obtained with TLBO and PSO are comparable and improved by 24%, 32%, and 42% for the minimization of voltage, heat input, and maximization of width-to-reinforcement ratio, respectively. Both algorithms are observed to be robust. The convergence analysis for the algorithms is also discussed. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2024.","2024","2024-12-14 21:21:41","2024-12-14 21:54:56","","671-683","","","364","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Smart Innov.
