DMSG3IAV,journalArticle,2024,"Alaparthi, S.; Subadra, S.P.; Sheikhi, S.","A Smart, Data-Driven Approach to Qualify Additively Manufactured Steel Samples for Print-Parameter-Based Imperfections",Materials,,19961944 (ISSN),10.3390/ma17112513,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85195827196&doi=10.3390%2fma17112513&partnerID=40&md5=3a40924e8133d7503ff14e9d42df335e,"With additive manufacturing (AM) processes such as Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM), components with complex shapes or with functional properties can be produced, with advantages in the areas of resource conservation, lightweight construction, and load-optimized production. However, proving component quality is a challenge because it is not possible to produce 100% defect-free components. In addition to this, statistically determined fluctuations in the wire quality, gas flow, and their interaction with process parameters result in a quality of the components that is not 100% reproducible. Complex testing procedures are therefore required to demonstrate the quality of the components, which are not cost-effective and lead to less efficiency. As part of the project “3DPrintFEM”, a sound emission analysis is used to evaluate the quality of AM components. Within the scope of the project, an approach was being developed to determine the quality of an AM part dependent not necessarily on its geometry. Samples were produced from WAAM, which were later cut and milled to precision. To determine the frequencies, the samples were put through a resonant frequency test (RFM). The unwanted modes were then removed from the spectrum produced by the experiments by comparing it with FEM simulations. Later, defects were introduced in experimental samples in compliance with the ISO 5817 guidelines. In order to create a database of frequencies related to the degree of the sample defect, they were subjected to RFM. The database was further augmented through frequencies from simulations performed on samples with similar geometries, and, hence, a training set was generated for an algorithm. A machine-learning algorithm based on regression modelling was trained based on the database to sort samples according to the degree of flaws in them. The algorithm’s detectability was evaluated using samples that had a known level of flaws which forms the test dataset. Based on the outcome, the algorithm will be integrated into an equipment developed in-house to monitor the quality of samples produced, thereby having an in-house quality assessment routine. The equipment shall be less expensive than conventional acoustic equipment, thus helping the industry cut costs when validating the quality of their components. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,2024-12-14 21:09:51,2024-12-14 21:49:49,,,,11,17,,Mater.,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: S.P.

One alternative to mitigate geometry-related flaws is to use algorithms that optimise trajectory choices—for instance, using heuristics to find the most efficient trajectory. The algorithm can assess several trajectory strategies, such as contour, zigzag, raster, and even space-filling, to search for the best strategy according to the case. However, handling complex geometries by this means poses computational efficiency concerns. This research aimed to explore the potential of machine learning techniques as a solution to increase the computational efficiency of such algorithms. First, reinforcement learning (RL) concepts are introduced and compared with supervised machining learning concepts. The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem is explained and justified as a choice within the RL techniques. As a case study, a space-filling strategy was chosen to have this machining learning optimisation artifice in its algorithm for GMA-AM printing. Computational and experimental validations were conducted, demonstrating that adding MAB in the algorithm helped to achieve shorter trajectories, using fewer iterations than the original algorithm, potentially reducing printing time. These findings position the RL techniques, particularly MAB, as a promising machining learning solution to address setbacks in the space-filling strategy applied. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,2024-12-14 21:09:54,2024-12-14 21:53:27,,,,3,8,,J.
