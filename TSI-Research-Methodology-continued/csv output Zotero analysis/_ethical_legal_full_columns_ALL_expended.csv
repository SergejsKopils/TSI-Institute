However, proving component quality is a challenge because it is not possible to produce 100% defect-free components. In addition to this, statistically determined fluctuations in the wire quality, gas flow, and their interaction with process parameters result in a quality of the components that is not 100% reproducible. Complex testing procedures are therefore required to demonstrate the quality of the components, which are not cost-effective and lead to less efficiency. As part of the project “3DPrintFEM”, a sound emission analysis is used to evaluate the quality of AM components. Within the scope of the project, an approach was being developed to determine the quality of an AM part dependent not necessarily on its geometry. Samples were produced from WAAM, which were later cut and milled to precision. To determine the frequencies, the samples were put through a resonant frequency test (RFM). The unwanted modes were then removed from the spectrum produced by the experiments by comparing it with FEM simulations. Later, defects were introduced in experimental samples in compliance with the ISO 5817 guidelines. In order to create a database of frequencies related to the degree of the sample defect, they were subjected to RFM. The database was further augmented through frequencies from simulations performed on samples with similar geometries, and, hence, a training set was generated for an algorithm. A machine-learning algorithm based on regression modelling was trained based on the database to sort samples according to the degree of flaws in them. The algorithm’s detectability was evaluated using samples that had a known level of flaws which forms the test dataset. Based on the outcome, the algorithm will be integrated into an equipment developed in-house to monitor the quality of samples produced, thereby having an in-house quality assessment routine. The equipment shall be less expensive than conventional acoustic equipment, thus helping the industry cut costs when validating the quality of their components. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,2024-12-14 21:09:51,2024-12-14 21:49:49,,,,11,17,,Mater.,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: S.P.

Therefore, optimising process parameters is crucial to achieving flawless products with consistent layer deposition. Hence in this research, the most important WAAM parameters including travel speed (TS), wire feed speed (WFS), and torch angle (TA), were examined in order to determine how they affected structural integrity while taking into account key responses such as porosity, pore diameter, and tensile strength. The Significance of Criteria Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) in conjunction with Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) was used to investigate the favourable circumstances and confirm that the TA is the most important parameter in the nucleation of pores. The verification studies demonstrate that a 58.2 % reduction in pore diameter results in a 31.8 % increase in tensile strength. An ideal TS and WFS of 65 cm/min and 5 m/min, with a maximum TA of 90°, were found to be the favorable conditions for printing Al5356 wall with a minimum porosity of 0.037 %, enhanced ultimate tensile strength of 278 MPa, and minimum pore diameter of 93 µm, according to the CRITIC associated WASPAS approach. Additionally, using the fractography, the damage process based on the porosity creation was investigated. The optimal parameters for generating a defect-free multi-layer structure were identified, hence enhancing the structure's suitability for industrial use. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024,2024-12-14 21:20:34,2024-12-14 21:20:34,,,,,166,,Eng.

However, high-density particles will sink and aggregate at the bottom of molten pool, which will cause defects such as cracks or porosity, decreasing the bonding between the deposited layers and deteriorating the mechanical properties of the components. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the migration behavior of particles in molten pool and the suppression strategy to improve formation quality. Here, a three-dimensional numerical model is developed to reveal the molten pool dynamics and particles migration mechanism during cored-wire-arc DED. The influence of molten droplets impingement and molten pool flow on particles migration behavior in the additive manufacturing process is investigated. Furthermore, the effect regulation of relative velocity between particle and molten pool on particles migration behavior is analyzed mechanistically, which reveals the sedimentation mechanism of the particles. Results demonstrate that molten pool flow velocity will influence the relative velocity between particles and molten pool, which will decide the acceleration of particles; moreover, the particles will sink while the relative velocity is in the same direction with gravity or the relative velocity is lower. Finally, ultrasonic vibration (UV) is introduced to suppress the sedimentation and aggregation of particles, and the corresponding suppression mechanism is revealed. UV will increase the flow velocity of molten pool, which will suppress the sedimentation and agglomeration of particles, as well as reduce the temperature gradient of molten pool, increasing the depth of penetration.

However, traditional machining methods are difficult to process titanium alloy parts, which further increases the cost of bipolar plates. The wire-arc directed energy deposition (WA-DED) additive manufacturing (AM) technology is low cost and high utilization of material. However, the undesirable microstructure always restricts the performance improvement. In this work, the electrochemical corrosion and passive characteristics of wrought TC4 and WA-DED AM TC4 alloys in the simulated PEMWE anode environment were investigated. The microstructure of AM TC4 alloy was optimized and the corrosion resistance was enhanced by heat treatment. The results indicate that the corrosion resistance of AM TC4 alloy is better than wrought TC4 alloy, and appropriate heat treatment can further improve the stability of passive film. Compared to wrought TC4, Ti −β phase fraction of AM TC4 decreased from 9.6 % to 1.3 %, and the heat treatment further reduced Ti −β phase fraction of AM TC4-850 and AM TC4-1050 alloys to 0.8 % and 0.1 %. The passive film thickness of wrought TC4, AM TC4, AM TC4-850, and AM TC4-1050 alloys calculated with the Power-Law model were 0.5 nm, 1.76 nm, 1.94 nm, and 2.02 nm, respectively. After heat treatment of 1050 °C, AM TC4-1050 alloy exhibited the best corrosion resistance, showing the lowest corrosion current density of 54 μA/cm2 and the lowest passive current density of 19.5 μA/cm2. Moreover, Ti oxide contributed most to the composition of passive film. In AM TC4-1050 alloy, the percentage of Ti oxides was 80.9 %, showing the best corrosion resistance. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC",2024,2024-12-14 21:20:37,2024-12-14 21:20:37,,753-769,,,93,,Int J Hydrogen Energy,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: H.

However, uneven welding and feed rates, as well as inadequate gas flow, can result in flaws such oxidation, gas entrapment, and humping. This study aims to reduce gas entrapment, maximize tensile strength, and reduced elastic modulus of the WAAM Al5356 wall by optimizing gas flow rate (13, 16 and 19 l min−1) in conjunction with welding and feed rates. The study highlighted gas flow rate as the most important component in pore formation and used the Entropy approach in conjunction with the COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) tool to identify ideal settings. The reduction in gas entrapment to 0.02%, as shown in the confirmation studies, resulted in a 33.9% rise in tensile strength and a 64.7% rise in elastic modulus. To verify these ideal parameters, elastic modulus mapping was done on the printed WAAM Al5356 wall. Moreover, the damage processes connected to gas entrapment and humping development were examined using fractography. Consequently, the research determined the ideal conditions to generate a multi-layer structure free of defects, improving its practicality in aerospace and automotive sectors. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The current study investigates the effect of welding conditions on the width of an additively produced layer by using Gas Metal Arc Welding - Cold Metal Transfer welding. Further, the Taguchi method was used to optimize the effect of weld settings on layer width which was additively deposited. The wire spool is made of Aluminium 6061, which has a wide range of industrial applications. Flaws, porosity, waviness,and weld bead's discontinuity on a surface could be minimized by the assortment and optimization of parameters or else, strange forms would emerge during creation of slender wall construction utilising Wire Arc Additive manufacturing. In Taguchi, an L9 Orthogonal array was utilised to investigate the input parameters namely wire feed speed, weld speed and voltage. The main plots identify the best parameter combination, while the analysis of variance determines the significant parameters. For the response variable, a linear regression approach is used to create a numerical model. The minimum width of bead of 2.39 mm is achieved at weld velocity of 0.9 m/min with wire feed speed of 6 m/min and at voltage of 12 V. The maximum width of the bead was 6.40 mm, achieved at weld velocity of 0.6 m/min with wire feed speed of 8 m/min at a voltage of 16 V.

To address this, 2319 Al-Cu alloy components were fabricated through the Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing + Interlayer Friction Stir Processing (WAAM-IFSP)1 technique, and a systematic study was conducted on the effects of deformation degree, deformation temperature, and strain rate changes on the microstructural evolution, revealing three distinct periodic microstructures. An increase in deformation degree resulted in a uniform periodic microstructure, attributed to the more uniform internal deformation caused by the increased deformation degree. At a deformation degree of 24.1 %, higher strength and ductility were achieved, along with a notable bimodal grain structure (BGS). Further research indicated that this structure would distribute more widely within the matrix with increasing strain rate, aiding in further performance breakthroughs, ultimately reaching an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 404 MPa and an elongation (EL) of 32 %. However, imperfections in the process led to inhomogeneity in the structure. Focusing on the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) mechanisms during stirring can improve this phenomenon. The research revealed that the fine grains in the BGS were controlled by a synergy of dominant discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) and auxiliary continuous dynamic recrystallization (CDRX) nucleation mechanisms. The findings are expected to provide a theoretical basis for the optimization of WAAM-IFSP processes and microstructural and performance regulation, which is crucial for enhancing the industrial application prospects of aluminum alloys. © 2024",2024,2024-12-14 21:20:44,2024-12-14 21:20:44,,,,,916,,Mater.

The results demonstrate that WAAMed samples exhibit coarse columnar grains with zigzag boundaries, interlayer heat affected band (HAB), and basketweave microstructures. The fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) is lowest in the Y-X direction while being similar between the X–Y and X-Z directions, indicating significant anisotropy. This difference can be attributed to changes in plastic region size and internal slip characteristics near the crack tip caused by variations in macrostructure and microstructure. After applying HAMR with quasi-β heat treatment, interlayer HABs are eliminated, resulting in uniform equiaxed grains and colony microstructures. The FCGR curves in three directions significantly overlap without any observed anisotropy, which are lower than those obtained for traditionally forged materials. Therefore, the isotropic FCGR of plastic materials can be reduced by achieving a nearly flawless metallurgical quality and ensuring uniform equiaxed grain matching with the corresponding critical colony size and fine thickness lamellae. The findings suggest that the application of quasi-β heat treatment in conjunction with HAMR offers a promising high-efficiency manufacturing technique for producing isotropic titanium alloy forgings characterized by exceptional damage tolerance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",2024,2024-12-14 21:20:48,2024-12-14 21:20:48,,,,,909,,Mater.

Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing-Cold Metal Transfer (WAAM-CMT) as a part of modern direct energy deposition technique can be recommended for developing aerospace components of aluminium alloys. However, it is still necessary to investigate the impact of the combined change of developing parameters on some of the crucial qualities including metallurgical and mechanical properties. Therefore, in this part of research work, practically, various process parameters were tried for development of aluminium (Al-5356) alloy walls. Finaly, a specific set of parameters namely wire feed speed, scanning speed and inter layer temperature parameters with two levels of each were selected and with the assistance of these, four walls have been fabricated. Th preliminary analysis showed that low heat input accompanied by higher scanning speed of 60 cm/min and lower wire feed rate of 6 m/min was found to best suitable set of parameters for developing dimensionally stable Al wall with flaw less microstructure. The said set of parameters also showed higher hardness that also accompanied with finer grains, lower percentage towards high angle grain boundary and lower KAM. Even slight variation in these parameters that deal to high heat input can give rise of porosity and misalignment in the wall. Details of microhardness reported high hardness in the bottom part of the wall. However, in a single bead the hardness is higher in the top region, which may be owing to finer grains in the specified region. The above said set of parameters also able to deliver better tensile strength and toughness for Al-5356 alloy. The developed alloy showed improved strength in longitudinal orientation owing to intra layer failure with ductile mode of fracture in contrast to transverse orientation, where the failure mode was reported to mixed (ductile as well as brittle) owing to inter layer fracture. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",2024,2024-12-14 21:20:48,2024-12-14 21:20:48,,,,,216,,Mater Charact,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Inc.,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: A.

Wire Arc additive manufacturing technology (WAAM) is an innovative production method that presents the unique advantages of high material utilization, a large degree of design freedom, fast prototyping speed, and low cast. As a result, WAAM is suitable for near-net forming of large-scale complex industrial production and has a wide range of applications in aerospace, automobile manufacturing, and marine engineering fields. In order to serve as a reference for the further development of WAAM technology, this paper provides an overview of the current developments in WAAM both from the digital control system and processing parameters in summary of the recent research progress. This work firstly summarized the principle of simulation layering and path planning and discussed the influence of relative technological parameters, such as current, wire feeding speed, welding speed, shielding gas, and so on. It can be seen that both the welding current and wire feeding speed are directly proportional to the heat input while the travel speed is inversely proportional to the heat input. This process regulation is an important means to improve the quality of deposited parts. This paper then summarized various methods including heat input, alloy composition, and heat treatment. The results showed that in the process of WAAM, it is necessary to control the appropriate heat input to achieve minimum heat accumulation and improve the performance of the deposited parts. To obtain higher mechanical properties (tensile strength has been increased by 28%–45%), aluminum matrix composites by WAAM have proved to be an effective method. The corresponding proper heat treatment can also increase the tensile strength of WAAM Al alloy by 104.3%. In addition, mechanical properties are always assessed to evaluate the quality of deposited parts.

Microstructure of parts exhibited the favorable two-phase ratio and the absence of σ-phase. It was found that appropriate heat input (1.68 kJ/cm) and cooling rate (5 °C/s) can effectively avoid the precipitation of σ-phase. Furthermore, the properties of the as-deposited samples were comparable to those of the samples heat-treated at 1300 °C, proving that no subsequent heat treatment was required for 2209 stainless steel fabricated by plasma arc additive manufacture. The samples showed excellent properties, in which the ultimate tensile strength and yield strength were improved by about 7% and 24% compared with GB/T4237-2015. The impact toughness meets the requirements of EN10028-7-2016, which is about 35% higher than that of the cold metal transfer samples, and the corrosion resistance is comparable to that of hot rolled 2205. © Wroclaw University of Science and Technology 2024.",2024,2024-12-14 21:20:57,2024-12-14 21:20:57,,,,3,24,,Arch.

The present work investigates the influence of scan vector length on the as-printed microstructure and recrystallization behavior of Haynes 282 designed by wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). The lengths of the scan vectors used in this work were 25 and 100 mm. Moreover, we studied the effect of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) and subsequent aging heat treatment on the evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties. The outcomes of our study reveal that longer scan vectors induce high cooling rates, leading to a finer grain structure and accelerated recrystallization kinetics in WAAM Haynes 282. Conversely, shorter scan vectors yield coarser microstructures accompanied by stronger texture. HIP reduces the porosity to ∼1 % and is accompanied by γ' precipitation during the furnace cooling, which can be dissolved during initial aging at 1010°C and subsequently reprecipitated via secondary aging, thereby increasing the hardness. Tensile tests unveiled that those specimens subjected to HIP exhibit yield strength at par with wrought Haynes 282. This research highlights the significance of optimizing scanning strategies and post-heat treatments to tailor the microstructure and improve the mechanical properties of Haynes 282 fabricated by WAAM. © 2024",2024,2024-12-14 21:20:58,2024-12-14 21:20:58,,781-789,,,119,,J.

Despite the advancement, the arc stabilization mechanism in the SCA remains poorly understood, hindering its application as a heat source in welding or additive manufacturing. To elucidate this mechanism, various influencing factors such as power supply characteristics, shielding gas composition, IWA posture, and plasma main arc (PMA) were analyzed. An electrical signal and high-speed camera synchronous acquisition system was utilized to analyze current-voltage waveforms and arc shapes. The results indicate that the arc stability of the SCA can be enhanced by ensuring specific external conditions. Constant voltage power supply enhances the self-regulating effect of the IWA, maintaining the IWA and the PMA in a hybrid state at all times. Introducing an oxidizing gas to the shielding gas can effectively suppress cathode spot climbing and stabilize the IWA. The vertical spacing between wires directly impacts the PMA deflection, while the wire horizontal angle has a lesser effect. The heat-regulating effect of the PMA column boosts the arc length regulation by the IWA. The current and the ion gas flow rate in the PMA minimally influence the SCA stability. These findings can provide a solid foundation for further applications of the SCA as heat source. © 2024 The Authors",2024,2024-12-14 21:20:59,2024-12-14 21:20:59,,83-92,,,31,,J. Mater. Res.

Accurate and rapid prediction of the thermal history is a critical prerequisite for functional quality assurance of WAAM parts. In the spectral graph method, the WAAM part is represented as a set of discrete nodes encompassed by a network graph. The thermal history is obtained by solving the heat equation on the network graph. The spectral graph theory approach thus bypasses the cumbersome computational burden associated with mesh generation in the finite element method. To validate the spectral graph theory approach, experimental temperature data is acquired for multi-layer mild steel WAAM parts processed under six different combinations of shape and inter-layer dwell time conditions. Further, each experiment was replicated resulting in a total of 12 parts. The accuracy of the thermal trends predicted by the spectral graph theory approach was quantified in terms of the symmetric mean absolute percent error (SMAPE) and root mean squared error (RMSE, °C). The thermal history trends were predicted with SMAPE < 5% and RMSE < 11 °C relative to the experimental temperature measurements. The computation time to obtain the thermal history of each 21-layer part was approximately 3.5 to 4 h. The spectral graph theory predictions were further verified with a commercial finite element software package (Simufact-Welding). For a similar level of SMAPE and RMSE as the spectral graph theory approach, the FE-based Simufact predictions required over 7.5 h. The computational advantage of the spectral graph theory approach is particularly valuable for devising physics-based process parameter optimization and feedforward control strategies to mitigate flaw formation in WAAM parts. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024,2024-12-14 21:20:59,2024-12-14 21:20:59,,5271-5298,,11-12,133,,Int J Adv Manuf Technol,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: K.D.

Nonetheless, achieving this accuracy is challenging due to the complex interactions between process inputs and the data structure of the 3D profile data. Our solution, a 3D profile-based control framework, addresses this challenge by actively adapting and controlling the manufacturing process to enhance 3D shape accuracy. 3D profile scans represent the ultimate measure of desired part quality. Therefore, utilizing them as the system responses for control purposes yields the most direct and effective feedback. We leverage recent advancements from Koopman operator theory to create an effective model-based control strategy. Initially, we estimate the process model by exploring the relationship between 3D profiles and heterogeneous process inputs. Then, we formulate an online model predictive control law. Challenges include dealing with unstructured, high-dimensional 3D point cloud data, capturing spatial and temporal structures, and integrating heterogeneous, high-dimensional process input data into the control model. To overcome these challenges, we introduce RETROFIT, a solution designed for the real-time control of time-dependent 3D point cloud profiles. Unlike traditional models, RETROFIT is not bound by linear assumptions and can handle unstructured 3D point cloud data directly. We demonstrate its effectiveness through a wire arc additive manufacturing case study, highlighting its potential to enhance 3D profile accuracy in manufacturing processes. © 2024 by ASME.",2024,2024-12-14 21:21:04,2024-12-14 21:21:04,,,,6,146,,J Manuf Sci Eng,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME),"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.

This work explores the fatigue performance of aluminum alloy 2319 fabricated by wire-based Directed Energy Deposition (DED) with Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) process, i.e., wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) technology. The as-deposited 2319 wall microstructure was composed by both columnar dendrites and equiaxed grains along the build direction (BD). Also, fine and coarse θ and θ′ precipitates were noticed in the WAAM printed 2319 wall due to repeated thermal cycles while fine precipitates were observed in wrought alloy. The microhardness measurements revealed a gradual decrease from the bottom to the top layers and varied between 65 and 86 HV. Tensile properties (yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation) measured in the horizontal and vertical directions were 99 ± 4 MPa, 268 ± 11 MPa 14.8 ± 1.5% and 96 ± 3 MPa, 257 ± 9 MPa, and 15.6 ± 2%, respectively. The WAAM 2319 fabricated in this work retained 72% of the strength of their AA2219-T62 wrought counterparts, which can be attributed to the large columnar grains that developed during the additive manufacturing process. The fatigue strength of WAAM 2319 specimen was 67 MPa, corresponding to 65% of the fatigue strength of AA2219-T62. Fracture surface analysis revealed the presence of small and large dimples, secondary micro-cracks, broken intermetallics, and inclusions.

In order to investigate the mechanical properties of the connection joint of WAAM carbon steel T-stubs, a series of 12 sets of connection joint specimens consisting of WAAM carbon steel T-stubs, high-strength steel (HSS) T-stubs and high-strength bolts were designed. The effects of bolt line position and bolt arrangement on the initial stiffness, failure mode and ultimate bearing capacity of the specimens were investigated by tests. Geometrical parameters of WAAM carbon steel T-stubs were measured by 3D laser scanning technology. Digital image correlation (DIC) technology was used to assist in measuring the displacement response of T-stub connection joints during the loading process. The test results show that WAAM carbon steel T-stubs have superior mechanical properties. As the distance between the bolt line and the web-flange junction decreases, the initial stiffness and ultimate load capacity of the specimens tend to increase, while the failure mode is all the expected flange damage, and the bolts do not fracture. In order to evaluate the applicability and accuracy of the relevant calculation methods by comparing the test results with the calculation results of existing design regulations, comparison results show that the existing design method overestimates the initial stiffness of the specimens, and predicts the damage modes more accurately, but the predictions of the ultimate load capacity are conservative. At last, the existing calculation model was modified, and the modified calculation model predicts the ultimate bearing capacity of the connection joints better. © 2024 Central South University of Technology.

However, the use of additively manufactured parts for load-bearing structural applications, specifically involving cyclic loading, requires a thorough investigation of material fatigue properties. These properties can be affected by many factors, including residual stresses and crack tip shielding mechanisms, which can be very different from those of conventionally manufactured materials. This research focuses on super duplex stainless steels (SDSSs) fabricated with wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) and investigates their fatigue crack growth rates and the net effect of crack tip shielding mechanisms. Using the compliance-based method, we measured crack tip opening loads in compact tension (CT) specimens with cracks propagating longitudinally and transversely to the WAAM deposition direction. It was found that fatigue crack growth rates were very similar in both directions when correlated by the effective stress intensity factor range. However, the differences in crack tip opening loads explain a quite significant influence of the deposition direction on the fatigue life. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,2024-12-14 21:21:11,2024-12-14 21:21:11,,,,8,17,,Mater.,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: A.

During additive manufacturing, multiple thermal cycles and partial remelting of the TiAl deposition layers take place. Therefore, the heat input would exert significant influences on microstructural and mechanical characteristics of additively manufactured TiAl alloys. In this study, TiAl alloys were prepared successfully by twin-wire directed energy deposition-arc (TW-DED-arc). Systematic studies were conducted to regulate the microstructure characteristic and the mechanical property of the as-deposited TiAl alloys via the line energy. The results indicate strong effects of the line energy on the microstructure and performance of the TiAl alloys, which show alternative distribution of layer-band like microstructure with the dendritic grains and the fully lamellar colonies along the deposition direction. With the enhancement in the line energy, the layer-band like feature gradually weakens, and the fully lamellar colonies increase. In addition, the discontinuous coarsen phenomenon and the discontinuous dynamic recrystallization occurred, and the anneal twin was also formed. On the other hand, tensile fractures were observed in the dendritic grains region, and the maximum tensile strength was achieved with the medium line energy. However, the elongation and microhardness are proportional to the line energy. With the elevation in the line energy, the elongation and microhardness gradually increases and decreases, respectively. The microstructure formation mechanism of as-fabricated TiAl alloy is analyzed systematically, and the fracture mechanics was also discussed in detail. The findings of this research contribute not only to the methodology for fabrication of TiAl alloys with the novel TW-DED-arc process, but also to the deep understanding on the regulation of the microstructural and mechanical characteristics of the additively manufactured TiAl alloys. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2024,2024-12-14 21:21:15,2024-12-14 21:21:15,,,,,165,,Intermet,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: C.

It is gaining interest due to its low buy-to-fly ratio. Nevertheless, its major flaw is the low geometric accuracy and the wavy surfaces of the printed parts. To ensure that the requirements of the final part are respected, the dimensions and the minimum quantity of material to be machined have to be specified. Thus, machining allowance and part dimensions are elements that were quantified based on a design of experiments (DOE) and thermal analysis. It was used to determine the effects of cold metal transfer (CMT) parameters on them. For instance, it was found that travel speed and interpass time have a major influence on height, width, and machining allowance. Specific way to achieve the desired requirements is discussed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2023.",2024,2024-12-14 21:21:15,2024-12-14 21:21:15,,739-748,,2,131,,Int J Adv Manuf Technol,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: M.

The spectrum of WAAM applications has rapidly extended, especially over the last decade, including but not limited to offshore and maritime applications, low-volume manufacturing and prototyping, moulds, tooling repair and renovation, and large-sized parts. The present article reports the functionally graded deposition (FGD) with varying compositions of dissimilar steel using twin WAAM. The obtained FGD structure interface displays two distinct zones made up of deposits of austenitic stainless steel (ASS) and low carbon steel (LCS), and it is devoid of any welding flaws. Additionally, several investigations of FGD structure were carried out to obtain a detailed analysis of its mechanical and microstructural characteristics. LCS had a ferrite morphology that was acicular and polygonal, while the microstructure of ASS showed vermicular δ-ferrite and lathy morphology. Hardness profile near the interface of FGD shows a considerable increase in hardness as chromium shifts from ASS to LCS. FGD ultimate tensile strength (UTS) is higher than LCS (499.46 ± 11 MPa) but lower than ASS (583.75 ± 10), but FGD yield strength (YS) is higher than both ASS and LCS because of elements diffusion. Overall, the interface of FGD structure showed significant mechanical bonding and durability.

The laser wire directed energy deposition process combines the advantages of powder directed energy deposition and other wire-based additive manufacturing processes, such as wire arc additive manufacturing, as it provides both appreciable resolution and high deposition rates. However, the process tends to create sub-optimal quality parts with poor surface finish, geometric distortion, and delamination in extreme cases. This sub-optimal quality stems from poorly understood thermophysical phenomena and stochastic effects. Hence, flaw formation often occurs despite considerable effort to optimize the processing parameters. In order to overcome this limitation of laser wire directed energy deposition, real-time and accurate monitoring of the process quality state is the essential first step for future closed-loop quality control of the process. In this work we extracted low-level, physically intuitive, features from acquired meltpool images. Physically intuitive features such as meltpool shape, size, and brightness provide a fundamental understanding of the processing regimes that are understandable by human operators. These physically intuitive features were used as inputs to simple machine learning models, such as k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, etc., trained to classify the process state into one of four possible regimes. Using simple machine learning models forgoes the need to use complex black box modeling such as convolutional neural networks to monitor the high speed meltpool images to determine process stability. The classified regimes identified in this work were stable, dripping, stubbing, and incomplete melting. Regimes such as dripping, stubbing, and incomplete melting regimes fall under the realm of unstable processing conditions that are liable to lead to flaw formation in the laser wire directed energy deposition process. The foregoing three process regimes are the primary source of sub-optimal quality parts due to the degradation of the single-track quality that are the fundamental building block of all manufactured samples. Through a series of single-track experiments conducted over 128 processing conditions, we show that the developed approach is capable of accurately classifying the process state with a statistical fidelity approaching 90% F-score. This level of statistical fidelity was achieved using eight physically intuitive meltpool morphology and intensity features extracted from 159,872 meltpool images across all 128 process conditions. These eight physically intuitive features were then used for the training and testing of a support vector machine learning model. This prediction fidelity achieved using physically intuitive features is at par with computationally intense deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks. © 2024 by ASME.",2024,2024-12-14 21:21:20,2024-12-14 21:21:20,,,,,1,,,,,,,,American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME),,English,,,Scopus,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

This study seeks to examine the influence of five input process parameters, specifically voltage, current, welding speed, nozzle-to-plate distance, and powder feed rate, at five different levels on the appearance of the bead in samples created using the self-shielded wire powder arc additive manufacturing process with low-carbon steel. Response surface methodology is used to analyze bead geometry, and a comparison analysis is performed to compare the effects of process parameters in conventional and advanced approaches. The appropriateness of the experimental design is evaluated by conducting an analysis of variance on a central composite design matrix that includes five process parameters. The observations indicate that the maximum width of the weld bead is 7.10 mm and the highest height is 4.49 mm. On the other hand, the minimum penetration depth is 1.09 mm, and the minimum dilution is 21%. The ideal input parameters are anticipated to be 21V voltage, 160A current, 5.5 mm/s welding speed, 15mm nozzle-to-plate distance, and 56 gms/min powder feed rate. The most influential component in determining various responses is current, followed by powder feed rate and welding speed. Scanning electron microscopy reveals that the weld bead region consists of both pearlite and Widmanstätten ferrite.

The lightweight of structural components is mainly realized by structural design and material selection. Therefore,the WAAM (wire-arc additive manufacturing)technology with the characteristics of free forming large scale and complex shape components has received continuous attention. The density of magnesium alloy is about 1. 8 g / cm3,which is one of the lightest metal structural materials in practical engineering applications. These two points have led to a focus on the production research of arc additive magnesium alloy large complex components. However,WAAM involves complex physical changes such as electromagnetic,heat transfer and fluid. Meanwhile,magnesium alloys are prone to oxidation and volatilization,which poses a severe test for the process control of WAAM. Herein,this paper summarizes the basic process categories of the WAAM technology for magnesium alloys,analyzes the influence law and deep mechanism of main process parameters on the forming quality,microstructure and mechanical properties of magnesium alloy manufactured by WAAM,points out the existing problems of the WAAM technology for magnesium alloys,and finally puts forward some suggestions and prospects for the future research direction of the WAAM technology for magnesium alloys. © 2024 Cailiao Daobaoshe/ Materials Review.

Long-term, high-precision, and real-time detection of melt pool characteristics is one of the major challenges in the industrial application of additive manufacturing technology. This work proposes, for the first time, the melt pool characteristics detection platform based on multi-information fusion in the plasma arc welding (PAW) process, which fully utilizes real-time photodiode signals and high-precision, information-rich melt pool temperature fields. By optimizing the detection area and wavelength selection of the platform, particularly through the unique photodiode signal acquisition system capable of detecting the high-sensitivity area of the melt pool, we effectively mitigate the influences of intense arc light and welding wire obstruction on the temperature signals and photodiode signals. Through applying machine learning, the trained model integrates photodiode signals with temperature signals from the high-sensitivity area, thereby achieving real-time acquisition of high-precision average temperature. By combining the fused signals collected from the platform and the scanning results from micro-computed tomography (CT), we evaluate and verify the influence of flaws and droplets on the melt pool characteristics, realizing the determination of flaw occurrence based on the abnormal variations of average temperature.

Robot-based additive manufacturing allows non-planar and non-uniform thickness layers to be deposited where the slices have non-constant thickness. Thus, in addition to the motion settings, fine regulations of the welding parameters become necessary to obtain variable bead heights in the same slice. This paper aims to evaluate the user-accessible welding parameters’ influence on the deposited material’s dimensions during continuous Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) and its variant named CMT Cycle Step. In particular, the height and width of beads are investigated by varying the travel speed and the wire-feed rate (continuous CMT), as well as the size of the droplets by varying the number of CMT cycles and the wire-feed rate (CMT Cycle Step). In particular, the characterization of the material deposited during the CMT Cycle Step is not deeply studied in the literature. The experimental specimens are measured and the obtained values are numerically processed to yield empirical formulas that link the dimensions of the deposited material with the selected process parameters. The results show that CMT Cycle Step is more stable than continuous CMT, which confirms its higher suitability for accurate manufacturing. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2024,2024-12-14 21:21:39,2024-12-14 21:21:39,,415-424,,,,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Additively manufactured UHSSs have a unique microstructure that provides significant potential to achieve good mechanical properties. This paper reviews the latest research progress in the additive manufacturing (AM) of UHSSs with a special focus on defect optimization, microstructure-property regulation and the application of advanced assisted techniques for additively manufactured UHSSs. The property origin of UHSSs is firstly summarized in detail, including the influence of different alloying elements and phase composition in the microstructure on the mechanical properties of UHSSs. The AM techniques used to fabricate UHSSs and the characteristics of their forming microstructure are further illustrated, which involve laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), laser direct energy deposition (L-DED), and wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). The research progress on the three typical techniques for UHSSs is also reviewed. Moreover, the property regulation methodology of UHSSs is reviewed, mainly in the optimization of defects and the adjustment of the whole forming process. Significantly, the shortcomings of the present researches on AMed UHSSs and future challenges for development are discussed. This work is important for a better scientific understanding of AMed UHSSs and provides vital meaningful guidelines for the future work in UHSSs manufacturing. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023,2024-12-14 21:21:44,2024-12-14 21:21:44,,,,,965,,J Alloys Compd,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 58; Correspondence Address: K.

While the low ductility and high strength make it difficult to be deformed and machined. The wire-arc directed energy deposition (DED) process allows a high deposition rate and can produce high-quality parts. In this study, the SMSS thin-wall parts were fabricated through wire-arc DED with the cold metal transfer technique. This research aims to investigate the microstructural evolution regulation and mechanical performance improvement mechanism of the additive manufacturing SMSS parts and achieve good comprehensive performance. The microstructure of the as-deposited wall consists of full lath martensite with columnar and fine equiaxed grains in periodic alternation layer by layer. By regulating the temperature between each layer, the overall wall's microstructure is kept consistent. The yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of the as-deposited wall are 1046 and 903 MPa with total elongation of 9 % and impact energy of 16 J. Thus, the toughness and plasticity needed to be improved by heat treatment. Based on the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) technique and diffraction pattern analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the phases formed during the intercritical tempering process were identified as tempered martensite and reversed austenite. The enhancement of toughness is associated with austenitic transformation-induced plasticity. The amount of reversed austenite is 29.5 % at 600 °C and then disappeared at 700 °C. The best comprehensive mechanical properties were obtained at a temperature of 550 °C with an ultimate tensile stress of 927 MPa, yield stress of 850 MPa, impact energy of 33 J, and elongation of 18 %, comparable to the rolled parts. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2023,2024-12-14 21:21:44,2024-12-14 21:21:44,,11-22,,,103,,J.

However, it is generally known that AZ-series Mg-alloys exhibit inferior strength and Mg-RE alloys suffer from poor ductility. Herein, we describe a novel Mg-4.4Gd-2.2Y-1.0Zn-0.5Zr (wt%) alloy possessing excellent strength-ductility synergy (yield strength of 157 ± 1.15 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 288 ± 2.52 MPa and elongation of 17.1 ± 0.32%), achieved through manipulating precipitates enabled by heat treatment. Besides, the mechanisms of gradient microstructure caused by the unique thermal history of wire-arc DED and precipitates evolution induced by heat treatment are systematically revealed. The enhanced strength can be attributed to the dense lamellar long period stacking ordered (LPSO) structures developed by the solution treatment and the abundant nano-β′ precipitates formed by the aging treatment. Increased strain hardening rate and the fracture suppression impact of LPSO-structures worked together to provide the noticeable ductility. The combined impacts of both the kinking deformable LPSO-structures and special nanoscale closed volume configuration, which effectively relieve stress concentration and suppress crack propagation, are the major mechanisms of such an excellent strength-ductility synergy. This study thus sheds new light on the alloy design and precipitates regulation of large-sized Mg-alloy components with high-performance fabricated by wire-arc DED. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023,2024-12-14 21:21:51,2024-12-14 21:21:51,,,,,77,,Addit.

The significance of the research on metal transfer is to fundamentally improve the stability and welding quality of the GMAW process so that the process has high-quality and high-efficiency properties at the same time, which is suitable for modern precision welding and rapid additive manufacturing. To achieve precise control of heat transfer, mass transfer, and force transfer in the welding process, it is necessary to optimize and control the metal transfer process. This paper briefly introduces the basic principles and process characteristics of several current advanced metal transfer control processes. Based on the difference in metal transfer control method or welding process, it is divided into three categories: additional external force–driven metal transfer, precision regulation based on the current waveform, hybrid welding, and multi-electrode arc welding control.

However, their application in fatigue-critical applications requires a thorough understanding of the material properties and behavior. Due to the layered nature of the manufacturing process, WAAM structures have different microstructures and mechanical properties compared to their substrate counterparts. This study investigated the mechanical behavior and fatigue performance of Ti-6Al-4V fabricated using WAAM compared to the substrate material. Tensile and low-cycle fatigue (LCF) tests were conducted on both materials, and the microstructure was analyzed using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the WAAM material has a coarser and more heterogeneous grain structure, an increased amount of defects, and lower ultimate tensile strength and smaller elongation at fracture. Furthermore, strain-controlled LCF tests revealed a lower fatigue strength of the WAAM material compared to the substrate, with crack initiation occurring at pores in the specimen rather than microstructural features. Experimental data were used to fit the Ramberg–Osgood model for cyclic deformation behavior and the Manson–Coffin–Basquin model for strain-life curves. The fitted models were subsequently used to compare the two material conditions with other AM processes. In general, the quasi-static properties of WAAM material were found to be lower than those of powder-based processes like selective laser melting or electron beam melting due to smaller cooling rates within the WAAM process. Finally, two simplified estimation models for the strain-life relationship were compared to the experimentally fitted Manson–Coffin–Basquin parameters. The results showed that the simple “universal material law” is applicable and can be used for a quick and simple estimation of the material behavior in cyclic loading conditions. Overall, this study highlights the importance of understanding the mechanical behavior and fatigue performance of WAAM structures compared to their substrate counterparts, as well as the need for further research to improve the understanding of the effects of WAAM process parameters on the mechanical properties and fatigue performance of the fabricated structures. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,2024-12-14 21:21:55,2024-12-14 21:21:55,,,,18,16,,Mater.,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: S.

The microstructure, chemical composition, texture and mechanical properties of the LHM thin walls were investigated and compared with those of the corresponding single-material thin walls. Remelting and mixing of the previously deposited layer caused deviations in the chemical composition in both regions. The 18Ni300 MS region microstructure was composed of austenite and martensite phases with the K-S orientation relationship, and the 316L SS region microstructure consisted of the austenite phase. All samples exhibited obvious austenite phase epitaxial growth, causing grains with the same orientation to pass through multiple deposited layers. The cubic texture in the as-fabricated 316L SS sample disappeared in the 316L SS region of the LHM samples. The Goss texture intensity in the 18Ni300 MS region decreased compared with that in the 18Ni300 MS thin walls, from 20.6 to 6.36. The 18Ni300 MS region microhardness of the LHM samples of 263 HV was lower than that of the 18Ni300 MS sample due to the lower-hardness austenite phase. The ultimate tensile strength of the LHM samples was 635.25 ± 31.1 MPa, which was between those of 316L SS and 18Ni300 MS. The uniform and total elongations of the LHM samples were 19.85 ± 3.6% and 29.2 ± 2.3%, which were higher than the mixing law-calculated values. The plasticity improvement was attributed to transformation-induced plasticity and stress state variation. In the initial plastic deformation stage, the 18Ni300 MS region underwent more plastic strain with a high dislocation density, causing the strain-induced martensitic transformation. The 316L SS region was strengthened with high strain, and its necking caused stress state conversion from uniaxial to multiaxial stress. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",2023,2024-12-14 21:21:55,2024-12-14 21:21:55,,,,,881,,Mater.

To facilitate its wider application, in particular with structural integrity in mind, an improved understanding of the fatigue properties of WAAM materials is needed. Hence, an experimental investigation into the fatigue crack growth (FCG) behaviour of WAAM plates made of normal- and high-strength steels has been conducted and is reported herein. Following material characterisation, FCG tests on 13 machined compact tension specimens were undertaken, extracted in different directions from WAAM plates built using a parallel deposition strategy. Fractography of the tested specimens was also performed to analyse the mechanisms of crack growth. The material testing demonstrated an approximately proportional relationship between the hardness and ultimate strength. From the FCG tests, Paris’ law constants were derived for the WAAM normal- and high-strength steel specimens, revealing consistently lower material constants m for the latter. Similar FCG behaviour to that of equivalent, conventionally-produced steels, with no significant anisotropy, was found. The observed response was shown to be generally well captured by the FCG laws given in BS 7910, with the recommended curve for unwelded steels providing a close match to the experimental data and the recommended curve for welded steels providing conservative predictions. Additional FCG data on WAAM steels printed using the parallel and oscillatory deposition strategies were collected and analysed. It was shown that the two deposition strategies led to similar crack growth rates for WAAM normal-strength steels, but distinct FCG behavioural trends for WAAM high-strength steels. Finally, the fractographic analysis showed that the WAAM specimens exhibited principally brittle behaviour during FCG but somewhat ductile behaviour before fracture. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,2024-12-14 21:21:59,2024-12-14 21:21:59,,,,,173,,Int J Fatigue,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 30; Correspondence Address: Y.

WAAM also shows potential in in-situ composite manufacturing and gradient material preparation. Given the potential in wire arc manufacturing of double-alloy gradient structured materials, the walls were deposited using alternating feeds (depositing a layer of A wire and then depositing a layer of B wire) of high-strength-low-plasticity ZL205 and low-strength-high-plasticity 4043 welding wire. In this process, the liquid phases of the two types of wire were efficiently mixed, which showed a regular distribution of molten pool track and avoided evident defects. Generally, through such gradient structure design, high-strength low-toughness materials and high-toughness low-strength materials can be effectively combined, which achieves the regulation of mechanical properties. Specifically, the overall structural and mechanical properties can be improved by adjusting the proportion of a certain component. As an extension from the wire arc printing technology, WAAM shows extremely high application potential and industrial values. Moreover, the addition of a dissimilar alloy can decrease the formation of columnar grains during additive manufacturing. Such compositional gradient can destroy the columnar extensive growth during the deposition in WAAM. © 2023 The Authors",2023,2024-12-14 21:22:02,2024-12-14 21:22:02,,3835-3846,,,25,,J. Mater. Res.

The present research utilized a finite element model to investigate the temperature field, thermal cycle curve, temperature gradient and cooling rate curve of the deposition layer at different positions in the WAAM process. The microstructure distribution and grain size variation of the deposition layer at different positions were examined according to the experimental results. The microstructure evolution of the deposition layer in the WAAM was simulated using a macro-micro coupled grain growth model. The variation law of solid phase and liquid phase distribution with solidification time steps of molten pool under varying temperature gradients is analyzed. The results indicated that the average length and width of the grains continuously decrease from right to left in the top zone of the deposition layer. When the temperature gradient increases to a certain extent, both the liquid phase area difference and the solid phase area ratio difference within the same time step gradually decrease with the development of the temperature gradient. This research supplies a reference for optimizing the microstructure of WAAM aluminum alloy by adjusting the heat input and solidification parameters. © 2023",2023,2024-12-14 21:22:03,2024-12-14 21:22:03,,,,,214,,Vacuum,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 25; Correspondence Address: X.

In terms of arc heat source modulation，many researchers put forward arc additive manufacturing technology with different modification and modification of traditional arc. WAAM can be classified into three typical methods according to different arc heat sources，i.e. gas metal arc （GMA）additive manufacturing，gas tungsten arc（GTA）additive manufacturing and plasma arc（PA）additive manufacturing. GMA additive manufacturing technology has the characteristics of high deposition efficiency and easy to implement，especially the additive manufacturing technology based on CMT cold metal transfer has made important progress；the main disadvantage is that the droplet transfer might impact on the molten pool and affect the forming accuracy and quality. GTA additive manufacturing technology has the most stable arc burning processes，no spatter，high forming accuracy and high quality，especially suitable for aluminum alloy，nickel base alloy，titanium alloy and other metal materials. Compared with GMA and GTA，PA has the advantages of higher energy density，constriction and good directivity. However，the shortcomings of plasma arc，such as narrow reasonable parameter ranges，complex parameter matching and high heat input，also limit its application in this field. Due to the repeated heating and cooling of the layers during additive manufacturing，there are differences in the upper，middle and lower regions of the microstructure and anisotropy，and the properties are much different both along and perpendicular to the cladding direction. The thermal cycling process of additive manufacturing of metal materials is very important for grain size，layer performance and forming accuracy. Reducing the heat input in the manufacturing process of arc additive is of great significance for grain refinement，performance improvement and forming accuracy. Domestic and foreign scholars have carried out many studies on the control of heat input and grain refinement in the additive process. Additional assistance is an effective method，including cooling gas shock，ultrasonic vibration，adding nucleating agent and so on. According to the different ways to improve the microstructure，they are divided into two categories，namely，changing the cooling conditions of forming parts and changing the solidification conditions of molten pool. The emergence of new arc heat sources provides more choices for improving the forming accuracy and microstructure performance of arc additive manufacturing. With the application prospect of additive manufacturing technology becoming more and more extensive，the industrial field has higher and higher requirements for production efficiency，production cost and quality of molded parts，and arc additive manufacturing technology that uses arc as a heat source shows significant advantages of high efficiency，low cost and high quality. Arc additive manufacturing technology based on melting electrode has outstanding production efficiency advantages，can obtain high deposition efficiency，the accompanying droplet transition behavior caused by momentum impact，droplet overheating，easy to produce splash，etc. are the main problems of this type of technology，cold metal transition（CMT）technology reflects obvious advantages. Compared with melted polar arc additive manufacturing，arc additive manufacturing technology（GTA，PA）based on non-melting pole has lower deposition efficiency，but has a more stable arc combustion，molten pool solidification and forming process，and the efficiency of additive manufacturing technology compared with laser and electron beam heat source is greatly improved，which has excellent comprehensive technical advantages. Based on visualization，electrical signal，etc.，it is one of the current research hotspots to realize the fine control of the arc additive manufacturing process，obtain a more stable forming process and improve the quality of the formed parts. The study of new types of modified and modified arcs，flexible regulation of heat input，and regulation of the microstructure properties of formed parts had important theoretical significance and engineering practical value for improving the quality and widening application of arc additive manufacturing components. © 2023 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Rare Metals.

This process allows for large deformation in the deposited weld bead with lower energy input at higher temperatures, resulting in less work hardening. A thermal, mechanical and plastic deformation coupled finite element model is established to analyze the plastic strain distribution with different shapes of hammer heads and different deformation history. Compared with the flat hammer head, the spherical hammer head is more likely to produce large plastic deformation in deposited weld bead under the same force and energy conditions, and obtain more uniform microstructure. Different hammering temperatures higher than austenite recrystallization temperature with the spherical hammer head, are selected to study the effect on grain refinement of repairing layers. The OM, XRD, SEM and EBSD are used for grain, texture evolution and strengthening mechanism analysis. The results show that by introducing the spherical hammer head FH process at 980 °C slightly higher than the austenite recrystallization temperature, the grain size decreases gradually from the bottom repairing layer to the top one, showing a genetic evolution law. The topmost repairing layer grain size is refined from 353 μm to 30 μm, the average grain size of repairing layers is refined from 361 μm to 62 μm, and the strong {100} texture of the topmost repairing layer is reduced to be approximately random. The grain refinement is attributed to the combined influence of recrystallization and co-generation crystallization. Meanwhile, the yield strength is significantly improved, and the main strengthening mechanisms are grain refinement strengthening and dislocation strengthening, and the contributions are 42.0 MPa and 101.4 MPa. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2023,2024-12-14 21:22:04,2024-12-14 21:22:04,,387-402,,,94,,J.

Herein, a novel approach was developed by synchronously introducing a high-intensity ultrasound into the WAAM process. The effect of ultrasound on microstructure and mechanical properties of AM part along the build direction was explored for the first time. Experimental results show that the columnar grains of each layer are replaced by equiaxed grains under the effect of high-intensity ultrasound, and the grain morphology varies along the build height. Due to the acoustic cavitation induced by ultrasound in the molten pool, the grain size is significantly reduced, and the grain refinement strengthening enhances the mechanical properties. The yield strength and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) increase in the vertical direction by 16.4% and 15.8%, respectively. The in-plane anisotropy of UTS declines from 9.39% to 5.12%. The propagation law of ultrasound in large-size AM part is revealed. When the build height is less than 74 mm, the ultrasonic intensity gradually decreases with the height, leading to a reduction in the degree of grain refinement, which is consistent with the experimental observation. The research provides a theoretical basis and technical solution for controlling the grain structure during the WAAM process assisted with high-intensity ultrasound. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,2024-12-14 21:22:12,2024-12-14 21:22:12,,2381-2395,,6,58,,J Mater Sci,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Springer,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: Z.

This process uses an electric arc as the energy source in order to melt metallic wire and deposit the new material, similar to metal inert gas (MIG) welding. Industry has been slow to adopt WAAM due to the lack of process consistency and reliability. The WAAM process is susceptible to a multitude of stochastic disturbances that cause instability in the electric arc. These arc instabilities eventually lead to flaw formation such as porosity, spatter, and excessive deviations in the desired geometry. Therefore, the objective of this work is to detect flaw formation using in-situ acoustic (sound) data from a microphone installed near the electric arc. This data was processed using a novel wavelet integrated graph theory approach. This approach detected the onset of multiple types of flaw formations with a false alarm rate of less than 2%. Using this method, this work demonstrates the potential for in-situ monitoring and flaw detection of the WAAM process in a computationally tractable manner.

The most advanced technologies of additive manufacturing by wire-arc surfacing (plasma, plasma arc with a melting electrode, including cold metal transfer) with layer-by-layer forging with a pneumatic impact tool and subsequent heat treatment were used. Aluminum-magnesium alloy AlMg5, titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V, austenitic stainless steels 12Cr18Ni10Ti (AISI 321) and AISI 308LSi have been studied. Samples were cut from the blanks created by additive manufacturing – blades for standard tests for static uniaxial tension and cylinders for high-speed compression tests by the Kolsky method on a Hopkinson split bar. According to the registered and processed stress–strain curves for all materials, standard strength and ductility characteristics and the Johnson – Cook law of deformation and speed hardening were determined. For a correct assessment of the mechanical properties of additively produced materials, these tests were also carried out for each of them in the form of annealed rolled products. It is established that to compare the efficiency of various technological parameters of additive manufacturing, it is advisable to use static tensile strength and uniform elongation to rupture, having the smallest statistical variation. It was also found acceptable to approximate the Johnson – Cook law of the deformation curves of each of the studied materials according to averaged data, including various technological modes.

Based on this review, aluminium alloy 4043 (ER4043) is an Al-Si alloy frequently employed as a filler wire because it has superior fluidity and significantly fewer flaws in additively built structures. Next, dwell time and cooling efficiency during the WAAM process significantly affect bead geometry. Besides, a finer microstructure can be obtained with a better cooling rate. However, a coarser microstructure is obtained along with the increased deposition height due to heat accumulation and low solidification rate. Heat input is identified as the main cause of porosity, and CMT with a lower heat input is preferable and outperformed GTAW and GMAW in terms of mechanical properties. © 2023 College of Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Malaysia.",2023,2024-12-14 21:22:34,2024-12-14 21:22:34,,21-41,,1,20,,J.

In this paper, the effects of UIT on the microstructure and mechanical properties of 2219 aluminum alloy WAAM components were systematically studied. The effect of UIT on grain size and porosity was investigated by metallographic experiments. Electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) was used to analyze the effect of UIT on grain orientation and texture. The chemical composition and phase composition were characterized by energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The effect of UIT on mechanical properties was analyzed by tensile test. Therefore, the influence and strengthening mechanism of UIT on WAAM components are analyzed. The results show that UIT can refine the grain size and reduce porosity. In addition, UIT can increase the dislocation density, improve the surface residual stress, and distribute the precipitated phase evenly in the matrix, thus effectively improving the mechanical properties of the WAAM components. This study provides a basis for improving the quality of WAAM components, and has reference value for the application of WAAM and UIT technology, as well as the regulation of the microstructure and properties of 2219 aluminum alloy.  © 2022 The Authors.",2022,2024-12-14 21:22:44,2024-12-14 21:22:44,,781-797,,,21,,J.

The possibility of combining these materials to obtain parts with variable mechanical properties is an important task to be studied. The combination of two types of steel, mild steel ER70-6 and stainless steel SS 316L, for the fabrication of a wall by direct energy deposition was studied for this paper. The separate fabrication of these two materials was studied for the microstructurally flawless fabrication of bimetallic walls. As a result of the application of superimposed and overlapped strategies, two walls were fabricated and the microstructure, mechanical properties and hardness of the resulting walls are analyzed. The walls obtained with both strategies present dissimilar regions; the hardness where the most present material is ER70-6 is around 380 HV, and for SS 316L, it is around 180 HV. The average values of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) are 869 and 628 MPa, yield strength (YS) are 584 and 389 MPa and elongation at break are 20% and 36%, respectively, in the cases where we have more ER70-6 in the sample than SS 316L.

This paper studies the effect of Travel Speed (TS) and Wire Feed Speed (WFS) on process responses (height and width) of thin-walled 308L austenitic stainless steel wire arc additive manufactured (WAAMed) components. Analysis of empirical data indicates a non-uniform variation of responses with process parameters, which necessitates redundant machining of the component. To improve geometric accuracy as well as material efficiency, this paper proposes a new adaptive process control scheme for the deposition of thin-walled components. The proposed approach uses current layer geometry to adaptively predict process parameters for subsequent deposition based on a power law relation established between process parameters and responses. Analysis of measurements for thin walls WAAMed with SS308L material indicates that the proposed adaptive control scheme yields significant improvement in geometric accuracy (up to 18% for wall height and 9% for wall width) over open loop deposition. Further, it is also demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms open loop deposition in terms of dimensional stability and material efficiency for a designed component (hollow V-block used as a holding device for circular objects) fabrication. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2022,2024-12-14 21:22:51,2024-12-14 21:22:51,,8099-8113,,11-12,121,,Int J Adv Manuf Technol,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: S.R.K.

The experiment design was based on the application of two WAAM modes: the cold metal transfer (CMT) and a conventional self-regulated gas metal arc welding (C-GMAW) mode. Material thermal history was estimated with the use of finite element modeling and the microstructure transformations were assessed using the calculated continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagram. The microstructure was investigated with the use of optical and scanning electron microscopy. Mechanical properties were determined by tensile and microhardness tests, digital image correlation analysis was applied to detect the deformation zones during tensile tests of the functionally graded specimen. The results of the study showed a strong correlation between cooling rate, tempering time and microstructure and hence mechanical properties: depending on the thermal history the microhardness varied from 283 to 411 HV. Both C-GMAW and CMT modes resulted in the formation of two main zones: the no-diffusion upper zone and the diffusion lower zone. In the upper zone the microstructure is determined by cooling rate from 800 °C down to 500 °C. The upper zone consists of martensite, bainite, a mixture of martensite and bainite, martensite-austenite phase (MA) and retained austenite (RA). In the lower zone the microstructure is determined by the tempering time in the range 700–200 °C. The lower zone consists of a tempered martensite, troostite, sorbite, alpha ferrite, MA-phase and carbites. Both C-GMAW and CMT modes resulted in the relatively high ultimate tensile strength (UTS): 807 MPa for CMT and 759 MPa for C-GMAW. CMT and C-GMAW resulted in the different elongation in the horizontal and vertical directions, it ranged from 5 to 10%. Cooling rate and tempering time regulation allowed to manufacture the functionally graded specimen with the relatively high strength and with the predetermined fracture localization. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2024-12-14 21:22:52,2024-12-14 21:22:52,,,,,851,,Mater.

However, the microscopic mechanism of the mechanical property difference caused by uneven microstructure in different regions remains unclear for the WAAM 2319 alloy. The geometric properties of grains are described quantitatively in different regions for the WAAM 2319 alloy through EBSD data processing and analysis. The effect of grain orientation on grain boundary, including subgrain boundaries and the boundary of coincidence site lattice (CSL boundary), are explored with EBSD data. The grain boundary and dislocations are characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The distribution of geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) in the WAAM block at different regions is studied through EBSD analysis. The high Schmidt factor or Taylor factor (M) percentage was quantitatively calculated in different regions. Then the relationship between grain morphology and plastic deformation ability is established through these factors. The results indicate that the average grain size is small and located in the top and middle of the WAAM sample with a low critical Taylor factor (Mc). The Taylor factor in most grains easily exceeds Mc (Mc < M), which causes most dislocations to pass through grain boundaries quickly, and plastic deformation easily occurs in these regions. There are various CSL boundaries except Σ3 boundaries existing in the middle of the sample, which can maintain the high mobility of the grain boundaries. Therefore, more slip transmission in the middle of the WAAM sample can provide the driving force for grain boundary migration. Most grains with a high subgrain boundary density (above 2.5) and the geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density (5 × 1014 m−2) can hinder the movement of dislocations and improve the strength of materials at the sidewall of the sample. The Schmidt factor of columnar crystals is generally low (below 0.25), and the sliding system does not start rapidly in columnar crystals, especially at the bottom of the WAAM sample. © 2022",2022,2024-12-14 21:22:53,2024-12-14 21:22:53,,,,,850,,Mater.

A better bead topology positively supports the overlapping deposited in multi-beads between layers while actively assisting the subsequent layer's deposition in the wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM). Hybrid-deposited and micro-rolling (HDMR) additive manufacturing (AM) technology can smooth the weld bead for improved surface quality. However, the micro-rolling process will change the weld bead profile fitting curve to affect the overlapping coefficient. Design/methodology/approach: Weld bead contours for WAAM and HDMR were extracted using line lasers. A comparison of bead profile curves was conducted to determine the influence law of micro-zone rolling on the welding bead contour and fitting curve. Aiming at the optimized overlapping coefficient of weld bead in HDMR AM, the optimal HDMR overlapping coefficient curve was proposed which varies with the reduction based on the best surface flatness. The mathematical model for overlapping in HDMR was checked by comparing the HDMR weld bead contours under different rolling reductions. Findings: A fitting function of the bead forming by HDMR AM was proposed based on the law of conservation of mass. The change rule of the HDMR weld bead overlapping spacing with the degree of weld bead rolling reduction was generated using the flat-top transition calculation for this model. Considering the damming-up impact of the first bead, the overlapping coefficient was examined for its effect on layer surface flatness. Originality/value: Using the predicted overlapping model, the optimal overlapping coefficients for different rolling reductions can be achieved without experiments. These conclusions can encourage the development of HDMR technology. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2022,2024-12-14 21:22:58,2024-12-14 21:22:58,,1086-1096,,6,28,,Rapid Prototyping J.,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: Y.

However, the physical characteristics and decoupled transfer behavior remain unclear, restricting its application and development. A three-dimensional model of the bypass coupling variable polarity plasma arc was built based on Kirchhoff’s law, the main arc and the bypass arc are coupled by an electromagnetic field. The model of current attachment on the tungsten electrode surface is included for simulating different heating processes of the EP and EN phases in the coupling arc. The distribution of temperature field, flow field, and current density of the bypass coupling variable polarity plasma arc was studied by the three-dimensional numerical model. The heat input on the base metal under different current conditions is quantified. To verify the model, the arc voltages are compared and the results in simulation and experiment agree with each other well. The results show that the radius of the bypass coupling arc with or without bypass current action on the base metal is different, and the flow vector of the bypass coupling arc plasma with bypass current is larger than the arc without bypass current. By comparing the heat transfer on the electrodes’ boundary under different current conditions, it is found that increasing the bypass current results in the rise in heat input on the base metal. Therefore, it is concluded that using bypass current is unable to completely decouple the wire melting and the heat input of the base metal. The decoupled degree of heat transfer is one of the important factors for accurate control in the manufacturing process with this coupling arc. © 2022 by the authors.

Hybrid manufacturing processes employing both additive and subtractive processes can effectively reduce shape error. The predictive modeling of surface roughness in thermally assisted machining is described in this paper on the basis of three important parameters: feed per tooth, spindle speed, and workpiece temperature. The predictive model indicates that temperature has a very significant influence on the surface quality. An experimental study on thermally assisted machining was performed to obtain the variation law of cutting surface quality with temperature in order to determine the optimal process interval of subtractive processes. Through finite element simulation of thermally assisted machining, the influence law of external main cutting force and the internal mean stress of the cutting material were determined. © 2022 by the authors.

Due to repeated and periodic melting, solidification and reheating of the layers, the WAAM deposition technique results in some elastic, plastic and viscous deformations that can affect material degradation and crack propagation behaviour in additively manufactured components. Therefore, it is crucial to characterise the cracking behaviour in WAAM built components for structural design and integrity assessment purposes. In this work, fatigue crack growth tests have been conducted on compact tension specimens extracted from ER70S-6 steel WAAM built components. The crack propagation behaviour of the specimens extracted with different orientations (i.e. horizontal and vertical with respect to the deposition direction) has been characterised under two different cyclic load levels. The obtained fatigue crack growth rate data have been correlated with the linear elastic fracture mechanics parameter ΔK and the results are compared with the literature data available for corresponding wrought structural steels and the recommended fatigue crack growth trends in the BS7910 standard. The obtained results have been found to fall below the recommended trends in the BS7910 standard and above the data points obtained from S355 wrought material. The obtained fatigue growth trends and Paris law constants from this study contribute to the overall understanding of the design requirements for the new optimised functionally graded structures fabricated using the WAAM technique. © 2021, The Author(s).",2022,2024-12-14 21:23:05,2024-12-14 21:23:05,,47-59,,1,235,,Int.

Wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) is an AM process that can produce large metallic components with low material waste and high production rates. Typically, WAAM enables over 10-times the volumetric deposition rates of powder-based AM processes. However, the high depositions rates of WAAM require high heat input to melt the large volume of material, which in turn results in potential flaws such as pores, cracks, distortion, loss of mechanical properties and low dimensional accuracy. Hence, for practical implementation of the WAAM process in an industrial environment it is necessary to ensure flaw-free production. Accordingly, to guarantee the production-level scalability of WAAM it is fundamental to monitor and detect flaw formation during the process. The objective of this work is to characterize the effects of different contaminations on the acoustic spectrum of WAAM and lay the foundations for a microphone-based acoustic sensing approach for monitoring the quality of WAAM-fabricated parts. To realize this objective, WAAM parts were processed with deliberately introduced flaws, such as material contamination, and the acoustic signals were analyzed using the time and frequency domain techniques, namely, Power Spectral Density, and Short Time Fourier Transform. The signatures obtained were used to pinpoint the location of flaw formation. The results obtained in this study show that the effects of contamination in WAAM can be identified through the analysis of the acoustic spectrum of the process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2024-12-14 21:23:05,2024-12-14 21:23:05,,,,,51,,Addit.

A commercial wrought IN718 product was also studied for comparison. It was observed that WAAM parts developed highly-textured large columnar austenite (γ) grains along the build-up direction due to the epitaxy and high thermal dissipation rate. The micro-segregation of Nb produced an inhomogeneous γ-matrix precipitating non-hardening laves phases as a result of constitutional undercooling, high energy input and slow cooling rate of WAAM process. After the solution treatment, SA sample remained to be highly-textured solid-solution of γ-matrix and formed non-hardening delta (δ) plates with undissolved residual laves phases in Nb-enriched regions. These deprived the precipitation of beneficial hardening phases of γ″ and γ′ particles in γ-matrix during SA treatment. The high-temperature oxidation study of SA-treated samples obeyed parabolic rate law which was independent of oxidation temperatures. The oxidation mechanisms in the formation of oxide scale were found to be temperature dependent. At 800 °C, only a thin and continuous layer of Cr2O3 scale was formed externally at the air-alloy interface. A multi-layer of external Cr2O3 at air-scale interface, inner Nb-rich complex Ti0.67Nb1.33O4 scale at scale-alloy interface and internal sub-scale of Al2O3 was formed at 900–1000 °C. Due to the high lattice diffusivity of Mn+2 and Ti+4 cations through Nb-rich complex layer and Cr2O3 scale, a thin layer of TiO2 and MnCr2O4 was formed at the outermost part of Cr2O3 scale at 1000 °C. The oxidation reaction process of scale growth in IN718 alloys was mainly dominated by the outward diffusion of Cr+3 cations through Cr2O3 layer at the air-scale interface as the activation energies were found to be in the range of 250–290 kJ/mol for Cr2O3 (chromia) forming Ni-based superalloys. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,2024-12-14 21:23:08,2024-12-14 21:23:08,,,,,51,,Addit.

The RS measurement using the ultrasonic method is based on the acoustoelasticity law, which states that the Time-of-Flight (ToF) of an ultrasonic wave is affected by the stress field. Longitudinal Critically Refracted (LCR) waves have the highest sensitivity to the stress in comparison with the other type of ultrasonic waves. However, they are also sensitive to the material texture which negatively affects the accuracy of the RS measurement. In this paper, a Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing (PAUT) system, rather than the single element transducers which are traditionally used in the LCR stress measurement technique, is innovatively used to enhance the accuracy of RS measurement. An experimental setup is developed that uses the PAUT to measure the ToFs in the weld, where the maximum amount of tensile RS is expected, and in the parent material, stress-free part. The ToF variations are then interpreted and analyzed to qualify the RS in the weld. The same measurement process is repeated for the Wire Arc Additive Manufacture (WAAM) components. Based on the results, some variations between different acoustic paths are measured which prove that the effect of the residual stress on the ultrasonic wave is detectable using the PAUT system.

Due to the characteristic layer by layer manufacturing within the WAAM process, viscoplastic material effects occur, which can be covered by implementing a creep model in the thermomechanical simulation. Experimental creep tests with a wide temperature, load and time range were carried out to examine short-term creep behaviour in particular. A Norton-Bailey creep law is used to accurately fit the experimental data and describe the base material’s creep behaviour. Subsequently, the fitted Norton-Bailey creep law was implemented in the thermomechanical simulation of the WAAM process. Finally, to determine the effect of creep on global distortion and local residual stress state in the substrate, simulations of a simplified linear, three-layer WAAM structure, with and without applying the implemented creep law, were carried out and compared to experimental data. The thermomechanical simulation with implemented creep model reveals a significant improvement in the numerical estimation of distortion and residual stress state in the substrate. The maximum distortion is reduced by about 13% and respectively the mean absolute percentage error between simulation and experiment decreases by about 34%. Additionally, the estimation accuracy with respect to the local residual stress state in the substrate improved by about 10%. © 2021, The Author(s).",2022,2024-12-14 21:23:12,2024-12-14 21:23:12,,441-453,,3,66,,Weld.

Welded joints in offshore structures are usually considered potential spots for crack initiation due to the combination of high stress concentration at the weld toes, residual stresses introduced by the welding process and cyclic loading conditions in harsh, corrosive marine environments. The WAAM technique is a deposition method consisting of repetitive welding process that can be used as an alternative manufacturing technique for fabrication or repair of structural components. An important issue that needs to be understood in structural-integrity assessment of WAAM-built components is fracture-toughness behaviour. In particular, the sensitivity of fracture-toughness properties to corrosive environments must be examined in order to extend the application of the WAAM technique to offshore wind structures. Therefore, in this study, fracture-toughness tests were conducted on WAAM-built compact-tension specimens made of ER70S-6 and ER100S-1 steel that were initially exposed to a seawater corrosive environment prior to testing. All fracture-toughness tests were performed at room temperature, and crack length was estimated using the compliance method with a clip gauge attached onto the knife edge of the specimens. The obtained results, which include load vs. load-line displacement and J-integral vs. crack extension, were analysed and compared with the results of tests in air, without any exposure to seawater. The conclusions of this study show that corrosive environments affect the yield stress and R-curves of the selected materials and contribute to the overall understanding of the design requirements for functionally graded structures fabricated by means of WAAM technique for offshore applications. © 2022 by the authors.

The developed technology of hybrid additive manufacturing with layer-by-layer forging of each deposited layer of material is able to minimize the porosity of the product. To select the rational parameters of the technological process, the evolution of the porosity distribution over the cross-section of a linear element after its single forging with a pneumatic hammer is investigated. A numerical model of the process is constructed in the LS-DYNA® package, where the Gurson–Tvergaard–Needleman relations are taken as constitutive equations of plastic deformation of the material and porosity evolution. To determine the parameters of the Johnson–Cook hardening law, tests of the AMg6 alloy were performed in a wide range of strain rates. The impact of the pneumatic hammer in the numerical model was calibrated using an accelerometric and strain-gauged steel target, as well as by distortions of the cross-section of a forged bar made of AMg6 alloy. Calculations according to the model are compared with experimental data, for which two linear segments were made by additive manufacturing with and without layer-by-layer forging, from the cross-sections of which the slots processed for pore visualization were prepared. With this method of pressure treatment, the decrease in porosity in the boundary layer of the workpiece mainly depends on the accumulated plastic deformations and does weakly sensitive the appearance of a stressed state. The model allows you to predict the size of the area under the hammer head depending on the processing mode, within which the porosity is eliminated by forging. The use of such modes will ensure the manufacturing of products without residual porosity in the processes of additive manufacturing by surfacing with layer-by-layer forging. © 2022, Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod.

It has been shown that a relatively long-range chemical gradient occurs during the transition between layers produced with the two different titanium alloys, due to convective mixing in the melt pool between the substrate layers and new alloy wire. This resulted in a stepwise exponential decay composition profile normal to the layers, the width of which can be described by a simple dilution law, with steep local composition gradients seen within the boundary layers at the fusion boundary of each individual layer. The alloy-alloy composition gradients had little effect on the β-grain structure. However, they strongly influenced the transformation microstructure, due to their effect on the parent β-phase stability and the β → α transformation kinetics and reaction sequence. The microstructure gradient seen on transitioning from Ti-64 → Ti-5553 was significantly more abrupt, compared to when depositing the two alloys in the reverse order. Under WAAM thermal conditions, Ti-64 appears to be more sensitive to the effect of adding β-stabilising elements than when Ti-5553 is diluted by Ti-64, because at high cooling rates, stabilisation of the β phase readily suppresses α nucleation when cooling through the β transus, and the normal Ti-64 lamellar transformation microstructure is abruptly replaced by finer scale α laths generated by precipitation during subsequent reheating cycles. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2021,2024-12-14 21:23:24,2024-12-14 21:23:24,,,,,182,,Mater Charact,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Inc.,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 19; Correspondence Address: A.E.

Wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM), as one of AM processes, utilises electric arc and metal wire to fabricate fully dense and heavy metal parts at relatively low costs and high-energy efficiencies. WAAM was successfully applied in the production of several welding-based metal structures. Recently, there was a growing interest in WAAM processing of super duplex stainless steels (SDSS) due to their high strength and excellent corrosion resistance, which make them the prime choice for load-bearing structures in marine applications. Although a number of studies investigated the microstructural and mechanical properties of WAAM-processed SDSS components, little is known regarding their fatigue performance, which is critical in engineering design. This study reports on the outcomes of fatigue tests and fracture surface fractography of WAAM-processed SDSS. The results obtained indicate a significant anisotropy of fatigue properties and fatigue crack initiations resulting from internal defects rather than surface flaws. Based on these experimental results, we suggest an effective design methodology to improve the fatigue life of the WAAM-fabricated SDSS components. We also indicate that post-manufacturing surface treatments should not be underlined for the enhanced fatigue resistance of WAAM-processed SDSS structures. © 2021 by the authors.

The material property models of stainless steel SS316L component to be compared stem from three different sources namely existing database, initial wire and evolved component. The new property models were generated with advanced material modelling software JMATPRO based on chemical compositions analysed at initial wire and component using SEM–EDX. The flow curve for each material model was taken with the strain rates ranging from 0.001 to 1.0 s−1. In the numerical simulation, a coupled thermomechanical solution was adopted including phase-change phenomena defined in latent heat. Goldak’s double ellipsoid was applied as heat source model and simplified rectangular bead with hexagonal element type and meshing was developed to avoid extensive pre-processing effort and to reduce the computational time at post-processing level. Temperature behaviour due to the successive layer deposition was simulated considering heat transfer effect coupled to mechanical analysis. The adjustment of simulative transient to experimental thermal distribution lead to new fitted heat transfer coefficient. Prior to execution of numerical simulation, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to find the optimal number of elements or mesh size towards maximum reached temperature. It can be concluded based on the adjusted model, selected mesh size and experimental validation that numerical computation of substrate distortion with evolved material property of component and initial wire of SS316L yield closer average result within the relative error ranging between 11 and 16% compared to database material giving more than 22%. © 2021, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology.",2021,2024-12-14 21:23:51,2024-12-14 21:23:51,,,,1,21,,Arch.

The accuracy of the layer geometry during deposition leads to decreased material consumption and post processing machining costs, as well as reducing the occurrence of internal voids in the produced part. Closed-loop control can be used to guarantee a more precise deposition geometry. Thus, the relationship between the deposition parameters and the layer geometry (layer height and wall width) needs to be established in order to control the WAAM process. This paper focuses on modelling this complex mass and heat transfer problem for control design. It proposes a static model for predicting the deposited layer geometry of thin walls using process variables (wire feed speed, travel speed and contact tip to workpiece distance) and physical variables (arc power, inter-pass temperature) as inputs. The model is based on the well known Rosenthal solution for the temperature distribution due to a moving heat source in combination with a geometric parameterization of layer geometry. This layer geometry model is incorporated in a dynamic model of the GMAW process for control design and simulation. The proposed model is compared to experimental data produced by a GMAW power source using carbon steel filler wire for model parameter identification. Finally, PID controllers are proposed for the regulation of both layer height and wall width. Numerical simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed control methods. © 2021, Begell House Inc.

In this process, the fed metal wire is melted using an electric arc as a heat source. The process is sensitive to the arc conditions, such as arc length. While building WAAM parts, the metal beads overlap at corners causing material accumulation. Material accumulation is undesirable as it leads to uneven build height and process failures caused by arc length variation. This paper introduces a deposition speed regulation scheme to avoid the corner accumulation problem and build parts with uniform build height. The regulated speed has a complex relationship with the corner angle, bead geometry, and molten metal dynamics. So we need to train a model that can predict suitable speed regulations for corner angles encountered while building the part. We develop an unsupervised learning technique to characterize the uniformity of the bead profile of a WAAM built layer and check for anomalous bead profiles. We train a model using these results that can predict suitable speed regulation parameters for different corner angles. We test this model by building a WAAM part using our speed regulation scheme and validate if the built part has uniform build height and reduced corner defects.

A versatile 3D printing device using a DED-W Arc (Direct Energy Deposition by wire-arc) station to melt a metallic filler wire is developed to build titanium parts by optimizing the process parameters and control the geometrical, metallurgical and the mechanical properties of produced parts. In this study, the impact of two different CMT synergic lines on the energetic and geometric behavior of Ti-6Al-4V single deposits is highlighted. These are related to first order parameters: wire feed speed (WFS) and travel speed (TS). The results show difference on energy, geometric of deposits and different deposition regime between these two law with identical process parameters. The second part of this study focuses on the transition from single deposits to walls and blocks. By first choosing the best set of process parameters to make the construction of thin walls (composed of stacked layers), and then the research the optimal horizontal step of deposition (overlapping) for thicker constructions, results obtained made it possible to validate transition from single deposits (1D) to thick walls (3D) without any weld pool collapse or lack of fusion. © 2021 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.",2021,2024-12-14 21:23:57,2024-12-14 21:23:57,,250-255,,,1016 MSF,,,,,,,,Trans Tech Publications Ltd,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Mater.

Visual inspection results showed that the stable burning arc kept continuously melting the metallic wire. Because there is no current flowing through the droplets and molten pool, the important process feature of low heat input was revealed. A cubic boron nitride (CBN) ceramic nozzle is used to force the arc and to produce droplets pass through it for additional constriction and trajectory regulation. The constricted-shielding gas and arc plasma offer fine protection and additional heating for the melted droplets during the whole process. The arc length increased as the gas flow rate rose from 4 L/min to 10 L/min. The arc shapes became dispersed when the gas flow rate exceeded 10 L/min. The arc shapes and droplets transfer process can be improved by the ceramic nozzle. Both of the forming characteristics and metallurgical bonding strength can be dramatically improved. The geometrical dimensions of each layer can be effectively regulated through adjusting wire feed and depositing speed. © 2020",2021,2024-12-14 21:23:58,2024-12-14 21:23:58,,,,,183,,Vacuum,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Elsevier Ltd,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 19; Correspondence Address: C.

AM can create functional parts with lower cost and lead time than the subtractive manufacturing processes. In AM technology, flaws or defects can be present due to variations in the manufacturing process or quality of raw materials, so AM technologies must still be developed to ensure acceptable and reliable quality of the product. Ensuring the high quality of the AM is crucial for safety in critical applications such as the aerospace industry. Various destructive and nondestructive techniques have been used for testing the AM components and their properties evaluation. The use of various nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques is becoming popular for defect identification and characterization of the parts, and still, more techniques need to be developed for better performance and higher optimization. In this study, wire-arc AM (WAAM) parts as-build and heat-treated components have been characterized for nanomechanical properties and finding possible defects created during the fabrication process. Nanoindentation, surface profilometry, and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) were used to characterize various wire-arc additive manufactured Titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) samples. The samples were also being tested for material characteristics at different deposition locations and as-deposited versus heat-treated conditions.

Among the AM techniques, direct energy deposition (DED) processes are dedicated to manufacture functional metallic parts. Despite of their promising perspectives, the industrial implementation of DED processes is inhibited by the lack of structural health control. Consequently, non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques can be investigated to inspect DED-manufactured parts, in an online or offline manner. To date, most ultrasonic NDT applications to metallic AM concerned the selective laser melting process; existing studies tackling DED processes mainly compare various ultrasonic techniques and do not propose a comprehensive control method for such processes. Current researches in the GeM laboratory focus on a multi-sensor monitoring method dedicated to DED processes, with a structural health control loop included, in order to track defect formation during manufacturing. In this way, this paper aims to be a proof of concept and proposes a comprehensive control method that opens the way to in situ ultrasonic control for DED. In this paper, a control method using the phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT) technique is particularly illustrated on wire-arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) components, and its applicability to laser metal deposition (LMD) is also demonstrated. A specific attention is given to the calibration method, towards a quantitative prediction of the size of the detected flaws. PAUT predictions are cross-checked thanks to X-ray radiography, which demonstrates that the PAUT method enables to detect and dimension defects from 0.6 to 1 mm for WAAM aluminum alloy parts. Then, an applicable scenario of inspection of a WAAM industrial and large-scale part is presented. Finally, perspectives for in situ and real-time application of the chosen method are given. This paper shows that real-time monitoring of the WAAM process is possible, as the PAUT method can be integrated in the manufacturing environment, provides relevant in situ data, and runs with computing times compatible with real-time applications. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,2024-12-14 21:24:13,2024-12-14 21:24:13,,1191-1201,,5,31,,J Intell Manuf,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Springer,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 72; Correspondence Address: A.

Design/methodology/approach: Inclined thin-walled parts were fabricated with vertically placed welding torch free from any auxiliary equipment. The inclined features were defined and analyzed based on the geometrical model of inclined parts. A statistical prediction model was developed to describe the dependence of inclined geometrical features on process variables. Based on these models, a build strategy was proposed to plan tool path and output process parameters. After that, the flow work was illustrated by fabricating a vase part. Findings: The formation mechanism and regulation of inclined geometrical features were revealed by conducting experimental trials. The inclined angle can be significantly increased along with the travel speed and offset distance, whereas the wall width is mainly dependent on the ratio of wire feed speed to travel speed. In contrast to other welding process, CMT has a stronger overhanging capability, which provides the possibility to fabricate parts with large overhanging features directly with high forming accuracy. Originality/value: This paper describes a novel build strategy for inclined thin-walled parts free from any auxiliary equipment. With the proposed strategy, a complex structural component can be deposited directly in the rectangular coordinates additive manufacturing system, indicating infinite possibilities on the producible size of the parts. Moreover, equipment requirements and tedious program work can also be significantly reduced. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2020,2024-12-14 21:24:19,2024-12-14 21:24:19,,499-508,,3,26,,Rapid Prototyping J.,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: S.

Laser cladding is one of the techniques for enhancing the surface performance, hence extending the lifetime of many components in severe corrosive-wear environments. Laser cladding with wire consists in feeding the deposited material as a metallic wire, which is melted by a laser source and manipulated over the deposition volume. This process shows some advantages over powder-based systems such as cleaner processing environment, reduced environmental cost for producing the wire, better surface finishing, and a higher material deposition rate. By means of innovative equipment such as dedicated nozzle and wire feeder systems, well-customized manufacturing strategies can improve the coating quality. Among recent innovations, the change of the wire direction results in a forward final feeding speed. This type of feeding is called dynamic feeding. The controlled movement of the wire is well-known in arc welding, and its synchronization with the arc's electrical parameters gives a drastic increase in stability and controllability. Based on that, the present paper addresses a characterization analysis of the frequency of dynamic feeding process in laser cladding in terms of coating quality. In addition, a dynamic feeding equipment was developed with total flexibility of parameters regulation. Dynamic feeding oscillation showed good stability and lower dilution compared to the conventional method. © 2020 Author(s).",2020,2024-12-14 21:24:20,2024-12-14 21:24:20,,,,2,32,,J Laser Appl,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Publisher: Laser Institute of America,"<p>Export Date: 14 December 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: M.B.

For the very same reason, however, an important drawback of this process is the pronounced surface waviness. This waviness introduces multiple adjacent peaks and valleys at the component surface, acting as stress concentration sites which can undermine the fatigue performance. In the present work, the authors propose a framework to model fatigue crack propagation considering the effect of waviness at the component surface. The growth model takes the stress concentration factor as input and incorporates it in a two-fold crack propagation model of a planar flaw. The fracture mechanics based growth models are developed based on El Haddad's short crack model and the Paris equation for long crack propagation. The effects of stress concentration sites are firstly considered by modifying the short crack propagation parameters. Secondly by introducing a new crack length dependent stress intensity factor threshold, surface waviness is incorporated in the transition from short crack into long crack regime. The results show that short cracks originating from an as-built WAAM surface grow faster as compared to their counterparts originating from machined surfaces. © 2020 The Authors.

Qualification of metal AM part may need detailed test plans and test results in order to meet the design requirements with a certain level of reliability. Approval may also be needed in accordance with regulation codes and class rules. However, challenges and gaps remain between the current metal AM technology level and marine and offshore applications. In this paper, two major categories of metal AM processes are discussed: powder bed fusion (PBF) and directed energy deposition (DED) with powder or wire as raw materials and laser, electronic beam (E-beam) or arc as heat source. The main challenges are also investigated in this study as follows: 1) Optimization of build cost and part quality by selection of appropriate process; 2) Performance of the part under static and cyclic loading; 3) Evaluation of the effects of corrosive environments (seawater); 4) Lack of standardization of the AM process for quality control. This paper addresses possible solutions for these challenges and provides qualification framework for metal AM parts to be implemented into marine and offshore applications. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Stainless steel (308L), titanium (Ti–6Al–4V) and pure Ta were studied, each having different affinities for oxygen and nitrogen. Results show that WAAM parts made in air produce unacceptable oxygen and/or nitrogen levels for most applications.

Such metal work can be produced by arc surfacing. Highly productive surfacing with concentrated power source allows layer-by-layer formation of solid structures, thus, realizing the principle of additive manufacturing. In additive manufacturing the metal work is produced by melting some powder or wire. The methods which use powder as a consumable material are low productive, their application for manufacturing large-size constructions is limited and the powder is used inefficiently. Surfacing with consumable electrode in the shielding gas atmosphere can be applied as the basic electric arc method of layer-by-layer formation of solid structures. Application of this process ensures good atomic interaction of the layers. Thus, the aim of this paper is to study the microstructure, the mechanical behavior and the chemical composition of the layers produced by electric arc layer-by-layer surfacing with consumable electrode in the shielding gas atmosphere. The optical metallography method was applied to study the structure and the chemical composition was estimated by atomic emission spectral analysis. The microhardness was measured by diamond points indention. The research showed that the walls of the products manufactured by electric arc layer-by-layer surfacing have the gradient structure. It is only the last surfaced layer that has the dendrite structure. The underlayers are exposed to secondary heat treatment due to the heat emission from the upper layer. The percentage ratio change of manganese, silicon and carbon in the surfaced layers was observed. The percentage ratio of chrome and nickel through the layers was determined by the chemical composition of the surfaced material. There is an opportunity of producing a flawless wall of the hull structure. © 2019 SERSC.",2019,2024-12-14 21:24:40,2024-12-14 21:24:40,,699-709,,15,28,,Int. J. Adv. Sci.

It is critical that the artificial defects are a realistic representation of the flaws produced by welding. Cylindrical holes, which are usually machined after welding, are not realistic enough for our purposes as it is known that they are easier to detect than the naturally occurring imperfections and cracks. Furthermore, it is usually impractical to machine a defect in a location similar to where the real weld defects are found. For example, electro-discharge machining can produce a through hole (cylindrical reflector) which neither represents the weld porosity (spherical voids) nor the weld crack (planar thin voids). In this study, the aim is to embed reflectors inside the weld intentionally, and then locate them using ultrasonic phased array imaging. The specimen is an 8 mm thick 080A15 Bright Drawn Steel plate of length 300 mm. Tungsten rods (ø2.4-3.2 mm & length 20-25 mm) and tungsten carbide balls (ø4 mm) will be used to serve as reflectors simulating defects within the weld itself. This study is aligned to a larger research project investigating multi-layer metal NDE found in many multi-pass welding and wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) applications and as such, there is no joint preparation as the first layer is deposited over the plate surface directly and subsequent layers contribute to the specimen build profile, similar to the WAAM samples. A tungsten inert gas welding torch mounted on a KUKA robot is used to deposit four layers for each weld, with our process using nine passes for the first layer, down to six passes for the last layer. During this procedure, the tungsten artificial reflectors are embedded in the weld, between the existing layers. The sample is then inspected by a 10 MHz ultrasonic phased array in direct contact with the sample surface using both conventional and total focusing method (TFM) imaging techniques. A phased array aperture of 32 elements has been used. The phased array controller is FIToolbox (Diagnostic Sonar, UK). Firstly, a focused B-scan has been performed with a range of settings for the transmit focal depth. Secondly, a full-aperture TFM method has been processed. All the reflectors of interest were detected successfully using this combination of B-scan and TFM imaging approaches. © 2019 Author(s).",2019,2024-12-14 21:24:48,2024-12-14 21:24:48,,,,,2102,,,,,,,,American Institute of Physics Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: AIP Conf.

Wire plus arc additive manufacturing technology also belongs into this group of manufacturing processes. It has been investigated in the last twenty-five years, although the first patent dates from 1925. Wire plus arc additive manufacturing uses existing welding equipment, an electric arc as the heat source, and wire as the feedstock. In this paper, we explain some basic process planning and implementation techniques, as well as the main advantages and disadvantages of the process. In addition, we discuss the potential of in-process non-destructive ultrasonic testing application to this process, in order to inspect the quality of the part while it is being produced, and to enable eventual repairs in-situ. Some authors have already presented the idea of non-destructive testing for AM products, and stated that ultrasonic testing could provide the most reliable results for detecting the lack of fusion, porosity, and other possible flaws. While researches so far were limited to post-process testing, this paper proposes the idea of in-process testing, which could provide a chance to find the flaws and the defects earlier in order to change the parameters in-situ, and avoid production of the whole part if it is already recognised as unacceptable. Despite some constraints, we believe the proposed method has great potential and represents a challenge worth investigating in more detail in the future. © 2018 PEI, University of Maribor.

During WAAM of thin-walled structures, as the wall height increases, the heat dissipation to the substrate is slowed down gradually and so is the solidification of the molten pool, leading to variation of the bead geometry. Though gradually reducing the heat input via adjusting the process parameters can alleviate this issue, as suggested by previous studies, it relies on experience to a large extent and inevitably sacrifices the deposition rate because the wire feed rate is directly coupled with the heat input. This study introduces for the first time an in-process active cooling system based on thermoelectric cooling technology into WAAM, which aims to eliminate the difference in heat dissipation between upper and lower layers. The case study shows that, with the aid of thermoelectric cooling, the bead width error is reduced by 56.8%, the total fabrication time is reduced by 60.9%, and the average grain size is refined by 25%. The proposed technique provides new insight into bead geometry regulation during WAAM with various benefits in terms of geometric accuracy, productivity, and microstructure. © 2018 by the authors.",2018,2024-12-14 21:24:59,2024-12-14 21:24:59,,,,2,8,,Appl.

Appropriate interpass temperature control and heat input regulations are effective ways to realise and maintain the consistent thermal boundary condition during bottom-up additive manufacturing process. Equivalent heat dissipation factor is used to synthetically characterise the variation of heat dissipation in process of additive manufacturing. Combing with Rosenthal's analytical solution, a theoretical model is developed to optimise interpass temperature and heat input for each layer deposition, so as to realise stable additive manufacturing.

Stainless steel alloy 304L walls were fabricated using wire and arc additive manufacturing and subjected to mechanical tests to characterize location and orientation dependant properties and microstructural features affecting crack growth. Fatigue crack growth rate analysis in the high cycle fatigue regime was undertaken on horizontally- and vertically-oriented single-edge notch bend specimens extracted at several positions from the wall.
